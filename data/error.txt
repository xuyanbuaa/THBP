the sigmoid colon pelvic colon is the part of the large intestine that is closest to the rectum and anus it forms a loop that averages about 40 amp nbsp cm in length and normally lies within the pelvis but on account of its freedom of movement it is liable to be displaced into the abdominal cavity path it begins at the superior aperture of the lesser pelvis where it is continuous with the iliac colon and passes transversely across the front of the sacrum to the right side of the pelvis the name sigmoid aptly means s shaped it then curves on itself and turns toward the left to reach the middle line at the level of the third piece of the sacrum where it bends downward and ends in the rectum coverings it is completely surrounded by peritoneum and thus is not retroperitoneal which forms a mesentery sigmoid mesocolon which diminishes in length from the center toward the ends of the loop where it disappears so that the loop is fixed at its junctions with the iliac colon and rectum but enjoys a considerable range of movement in its central portion innervation pelvic splanchnic nerves are the primary source for parasympathetic innervation lumbar splanchnic nerves provide sympathetic innervation via the inferior mesenteric ganglion relations behind the sigmoid colon are the external iliac vessels the left piriformis and left sacral plexus of nerves in front it is separated from the bladder in the male and the uterus in the female by some coils of the small intestine additional images gallery image illu intestine jpg intestinesimage gray538 png sigmoid colon and rectum showing distribution of branches of inferior mesenteric artery and their anastomoses image gray1076 png iliac colon sigmoid or pelvic colon and rectum seen from the front after removal of pubic bones and bladder br hiimage weiblichesbeckenmedian gif sagittal section of the lower part of

thumb and marked jugular venous distension external jugular vein marked by an arrow thumb the jugular venous pressure jvp sometimes referred to as jugular venous pulse is the indirectly observed pressure over the venous system it can be useful in the differentiation of different forms of heart and lung disease classically three upward deflections and two downward deflections have been described the upward deflections are the a atrial contraction c ventricular contraction and resulting bulging of tricuspid into the right atrium during isovolumic systole and v atrial venous filling the downward deflections of the wave are the x the atrium relaxes and the tricuspid valve moves downward and the y descent filling of ventricle after tricuspid opening method visualization thumb the patient is positioned under 45 and the filling level of the jugular vein determined visualize the internal jugular vein when looking for the pulsation in healthy people the filling level of the jugular vein should be less than 3 centimetre s above the sternal angle a pen light can aid in discerning the jugular filling level by providing tangential light the jvp is easiest to observe if one looks along the surface of the sternocleidomastoid muscle as it is easier to appreciate the movement relative to the neck when looking from the side as opposed to looking at the surface at a 90 degree angle like judging the movement of an automobile from a distance it is easier to see the movement of an automobile when it is crossing ones path at 90 degrees i e moving left to right or right to left as opposed to coming toward one pulse s in the jvp are rather hard to observe but trained cardiologists do try to discern these as signs of the state of the right atrium differentiation from the carotid pulse the jvp and carotid pulse

diverticulitis is a common digestive disease particularly found in the large intestine diverticulitis develops from diverticulosis which involves the formation of pouches diverticula on the outside of the colon diverticulitis results if one of these diverticula becomes inflamed signs and symptoms patients often present with the classic triad of left lower quadrant pain fever and leukocytosis an elevation of the white cell count in blood tests patients may also complain of nausea or diarrhea others may be constipated less commonly an individual with diverticulitis may present with right sided abdominal pain this may be due to the less prevalent right sided diverticula or a very redundant sigmoid colon diverticulitis the most common symptom of diverticulitis is abdominal pain the most common sign is tenderness around the left side of the lower abdomen if infection is the cause then nausea vomiting feeling hot while having no fever cramping and constipation may occur as well the severity of symptoms depends on the extent of the infection and complications diverticulitis worsens throughout the day as it starts as small pains and slowly turns into vomiting and sharp pains diverticulosis most people with diverticulosis do not have any discomfort or symptoms however symptoms may include mild cramps bloating and constipation other diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease ibd and stomach ulcers cause similar problems so these symptoms do not always mean a person has diverticulosis causes the development of colonic diverticulum is thought to be a result of raised intraluminal colonic pressures the sigmoid colon section 4 has the smallest diameter of any portion of the colon and therefore the portion which would be expected to have the highest intraluminal pressure the claim that a lack of dietary fiber particularly non soluble fiber also known in older parlance as roughage predisposes individuals to diverticular disease is supported within the medical literature diet

right of the vertebro basilar and posterior cerebral circulation angiography or arteriography is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the inside or lumen of blood vessels and organs of the body with particular interest in the arteries vein s and the heart chamber s this is traditionally done by injecting a radio opaque contrast agent into the blood vessel and imaging using x-ray based techniques such as fluoroscopy the word itself comes from the greek words angeion vessel and graphein to write or record the film or image of the blood vessel s is called an angiograph or more commonly an angiogram the term angiography is strictly defined as based on projectional radiography however the term has been applied to newer vascular imaging techniques such as ct angiography and mr angiography the term isotope angiography has also been used although this more correctly is referred to as isotope perfusion scanning history the technique was first developed in 1927 by the portuguese physician and neurologist egas moniz to provide contrasted x ray cerebral angiography in order to diagnose several kinds of nervous diseases such as tumors coronary heart disease and arteriovenous malformations he is usually recognized as one of the pioneers in this field moniz performed the first cerebral angiogram in lisbon in 1927 and reynaldo cid dos santos performed the first aortogram in the same city in 1929 with the introduction of the seldinger technique in 1953 the procedure became markedly safer as no sharp introductory devices needed to remain inside the vascular lumen technique right depending on the type of angiogram access to the blood vessels is gained most commonly through the femoral artery to look at the left side of the heart and the arterial system or the jugular or femoral vein to look at the right side of the heart and the venous system using a system of guide wire s and catheters a

thumb a tonsillectomy is a 3 000 year old however according to the current guidelines 2000 of the american academy of otolaryngology &amp; head and neck surgery aao hns tonsillectomy is indicated if a patient contracts three or more attacks of sore throat per year despite adequate medical therapy has chronic tonsillitis consisting of persistent moderate to severe throat pain has multiple bouts of peritonsillar abscess has sleep apnea stopping or obstructing breathing at night due to enlarged tonsils or adenoids has difficulty eating or swallowing due to enlarged tonsils very unusual reason for tonsillectomy produces tonsillolith s tonsil stones in the back of their mouth has abnormally large tonsils with crypts craters or impacts in the tonsils controversy over indications the american academy of otolaryngology &amp; head and neck surgery aao hns stated that in many cases tonsillectomy may be a more effective treatment and less costly than prolonged or repeated treatments for an infected throat for the past several years the academy has been developing clinical guidelines based on evidence and outcomes research including quality of life after tonsillectomy a january 2008 supplement to the journal otolaryngology head and neck surgery morbidity and mortality the morbidity rate associated with tonsillectomy is 2 to 4 due to post operative bleeding the mortality rate is 1 in 15 000 due to bleeding airway obstruction or anesthesia effectiveness the effectiveness of the tonsillectomy has been questioned in a 2009 systematic review of 7765 papers published in the journal otolaryngology head and neck surgery the review found that it was most likely not effective all the time but rather was modestly effective and that not a single paper reported that tonsillectomy is invariably effective in eliminating sore throats another systematic review of cases involving children found that there was only a short term benefit a child who meets these strict criteria will probably suffer from 6 throat infections in the next two years

adenoidectomy is the surgical removal of the adenoid s they may be removed for several reasons including impaired breathing through the nose and chronic infections or earaches the surgery is common it is most often done on an outpatient basis under general anesthesia post operative pain is generally minimal and prevented with an abundance of icy or cold foods spicy foods such as jalapeños or curries should be avoided the procedure can sometimes be combined with a tonsillectomy if needed recovery time can range from several hours to two or three days though as age increases so does recovery time adenoidectomy is not often performed on children aged 1 6 as adenoids help the bodys immune system adenoids become vestigial organs in adults history the early version of adenoidectomy involved using a ring forceps through the nasal cavity to remove adenoid tissue by william meyer in 1867 by the early 1930s the operation became nearly universal in children of school age adenoidectomies began to be routinely performed together with tonsillectomies in the early 1900s initially the procedures were performed by otolaryngologist s general surgeons family practitioners and general physicians but over the past 30 years it became common that tonsillectomies and adenoidectomies are performed almost exclusively by otolaryngologists adenoidectomies were indicated in cases of anorexia nervosa mental retardation enuresis or for ones well being and to promote good health at this time the indications may seem odd they may be explained as children may fail to thrive if they have chronically sore throat s or severe obstructive sleep apnea osa obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition that has been related to enuresis also children who hear poorly because of chronic otitis media may have speech delay and be mistaken for mentally retarded adenoidectomies help resolve ear fluid problems speech delays and perceptions of low intelligence enuresis has actually

a fontanelle or fontanel is an anatomical feature on an infants skull anatomy fontanelles are soft spots on a babys head which during birth enable the bony plates of the skull to flex allowing the childs head to pass through the birth canal the ossification of the bones of the skull cause the fontanelles to close over by a childs second birthday the closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium other than the anterior and posterior fontanelles the mastoid fontanelle and the sphenoidal fontanelle are also significant the skull of a newborn consists of five main bones two frontal bone s two parietal bone s and one occipital bone these are joined by fibrous sutures which allow movement that facilitates childbirth and brain growth at birth the skull features a small posterior fontanelle an open area covered by a tough membrane where the two parietal bones adjoin the occipital bone at the lambda this fontanelle usually closes during the first several months of an infants life this is called intramembranous ossification the mesenchymal connective tissue turns into bone tissue the much larger diamond shaped anterior fontanelle where the two frontal and two parietal bones join generally remains open until the child is about two years of age however in cleidocranial dysostosis it is often late in closing or may never close the anterior fontanelle is useful clinically examination of an infant includes palpating the anterior fontanelle two smaller fontanelles are located on each side of the head more anteriorly the sphenoidal between the sphenoid parietal temporal and frontal bones and more posteriorly the mastoid between the temporal occipital and parietal bones clinical significance a sunken fontanelle indicates dehydration whereas a very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised intracranial pressure the fontanelle may pulsate and although the precise cause of this is not known it is perfectly normal

synovial membrane or synovium is the soft tissue that lines the non cartilaginous surfaces within joints with cavities synovial joint s the word synovium is related to the word synovia synovial fluid which is the clear viscid lubricating fluid secreted by synovial membranes the word synvovia or sinovia was coined by paracelsus and may have been derived from the greek word syn with and the latin word ovum egg because the synovial fluid in joints that have a cavity between the bearing surfaces is similar to egg white structure synovium is very variable but often has two layers the outer layer or subintima can be of almost any type fibrous fatty or loosely areolar the inner layer or intima consists of a sheet of cell s thinner than a piece of paper where the underlying subintima is loose the intima sits on a pliable membrane giving rise to the term synovial membrane this membrane together with the cells of the intima provides something like an inner tube sealing the synovial fluid from the surrounding tissue effectively stopping the joints being squeezed dry when subject to impact such as running the intimal cells are of two types fibroblast s and macrophage s both of which are different in certain respects from similar cells in other tissues the fibroblasts manufacture a long chain sugar polymer called hyaluronan which makes the synovial fluid ropy like egg white together with a molecule called lubricin which lubricates the joint surfaces the water of synovial fluid is not secreted as such but is effectively trapped in the joint space by the hyaluronan the macrophages are responsible for the removal of undesirable substances from the synovial fluid the surface of synovium may be flat or may be covered with finger like projections or villi which probably help to allow the soft tissue

thumb a tonsillectomy is a 3 000 year old however according to the current guidelines 2000 of the american academy of otolaryngology &amp; head and neck surgery aao hns tonsillectomy is indicated if a patient contracts three or more attacks of sore throat per year despite adequate medical therapy has chronic tonsillitis consisting of persistent moderate to severe throat pain has multiple bouts of peritonsillar abscess has sleep apnea stopping or obstructing breathing at night due to enlarged tonsils or adenoids has difficulty eating or swallowing due to enlarged tonsils very unusual reason for tonsillectomy produces tonsillolith s tonsil stones in the back of their mouth has abnormally large tonsils with crypts craters or impacts in the tonsils controversy over indications the american academy of otolaryngology &amp; head and neck surgery aao hns stated that in many cases tonsillectomy may be a more effective treatment and less costly than prolonged or repeated treatments for an infected throat for the past several years the academy has been developing clinical guidelines based on evidence and outcomes research including quality of life after tonsillectomy a january 2008 supplement to the journal otolaryngology head and neck surgery morbidity and mortality the morbidity rate associated with tonsillectomy is 2 to 4 due to post operative bleeding the mortality rate is 1 in 15 000 due to bleeding airway obstruction or anesthesia effectiveness the effectiveness of the tonsillectomy has been questioned in a 2009 systematic review of 7765 papers published in the journal otolaryngology head and neck surgery the review found that it was most likely not effective all the time but rather was modestly effective and that not a single paper reported that tonsillectomy is invariably effective in eliminating sore throats another systematic review of cases involving children found that there was only a short term benefit a child who meets these strict criteria will probably suffer from 6 throat infections in the next two years

olfaction also known as olfactics adjectival form olfactory is the sense of smell this sense is mediated by specialized sensory cells of the nasal cavity of vertebrates and by analogy sensory cells of the antennae of invertebrates many vertebrates including most mammals and reptiles have two distinct olfactory systems the main olfactory system and the accessory olfactory system mainly used to detect pheremones for air breathing animals the main olfactory system detects volatile chemicals and the accessory olfactory system detects fluid phase chemicals for water dwelling organisms e g fish or crustaceans the chemicals are present in the surrounding aqueous medium olfaction along with taste is a form of chemoreception the chemicals themselves which activate the olfactory system generally at very low concentrations are called odorant s history as the epicurean and atomistic roman philosopher lucretius 1st century bce speculated different odors are attributed to different shapes and sizes of odor molecules that stimulate the olfactory organ a modern demonstration of that theory was the cloning of olfactory receptor proteins by linda b. buck and richard axel who were awarded the nobel prize in 2004 and subsequent pairing of odor molecules to specific receptor proteins each odor receptor molecule recognizes only a particular molecular feature or class of odor molecules mammals have about a thousand gene s expressing for odor reception of these genes only a portion are functional odor receptors humans have far fewer active odor receptor gene s than other primates and other mammals in mammals each olfactory receptor neuron expresses only one functional odor receptor odor receptor nerve cells function like a key lock system if the airborne molecules of a certain chemical can fit into the lock the nerve cell will respond there are at present a number of competing theories regarding the mechanism of odor coding and perception according to the shape theory each

migraine is a debilitating condition characterized by moderate to severe headache s and nausea about 3 times more common in women than in men the word migraine was borrowed from old french migraigne originally as megrim but respelled in 1777 on a contemporary french model the french term derived from a vulgar pronunciation of the late latin word hemicrania itself based on greek hemikrania from greek roots for half and skull the typical migraine headache is unilateral pain affecting one half of the head and pulsating in nature lasting from 4 to 72 hours symptoms include nausea vomiting photophobia increased sensitivity to light phonophobia increased sensitivity to sound and is aggravated by routine activity approximately one third of people who suffer from migraine headaches perceive an aura unusual visual olfactory or other sensory experiences that are a sign that the migraine will soon occur initial treatment is with analgesics for the headache an antiemetic for the nausea and the avoidance of triggering conditions the cause of migraine headache is unknown the most common theory is a disorder of the serotonergic control system studies of twins indicate a 60 to 65 percent genetic influence upon their propensity to develop migraine headache moreover fluctuating hormone levels indicate a migraine relation 75 percent of adult patients are women although migraine affects approximately equal numbers of prepubescent boys and girls propensity to migraine headache is known to disappear during pregnancy although in some women migraines may become more frequent during pregnancy classification the international headache society ihs offers guidelines for the classification and diagnosis of migraine headaches in a document called the international classification of headache disorders 2nd edition ichd 2 these symptoms usually precede the headache phase of the migraine attack by several hours or days and experience teaches the patient or observant family how to detect

the buttocks singular buttock are rounded portions of the anatomy located on the posterior of the pelvic region of ape s and human s and many other bipeds or quadrupeds and comprise a layer of fat superimposed on the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscle s physiologically the buttocks enable weight to be taken off the feet while sitting many cultures have also used them as a safe target for corporal punishment and for some cultures they play a role in sexual attraction there are several connotations of buttocks in art fashion culture and humor and the english language is replete with many popular synonyms anatomy the buttocks are formed by the masses of the gluteal muscles or glutes the gluteus maximus muscle and the gluteus medius muscle superimposed by a layer of fat the superior aspect of the buttock ends at the iliac crest and the lower aspect is outlined by the horizontal gluteal crease the gluteus maximus has two insertion points 1 3 superior portion of the linea aspera of the femur and the superior portion of the iliotibial tractus the masses of the gluteus maximus muscle are separated by an intermediate intergluteal cleft or crack in which the anus is situated the buttocks allow primates to sit upright without needing to rest their weight on their feet as four-legged animals do females of certain species of baboon have red buttocks that blush to attract males in the case of humans females tend to have proportionally wider and thicker buttocks due to higher subcutaneous fat and proportionally wider hips some baboon s and all gibbon s though otherwise fur covered have characteristic naked callosities on their buttocks while human children generally have smooth buttocks mature males and females have varying degrees of hair growth as on other parts of their body females may have hair growth in the gluteal cleft including around the anus

the pulmonary airway comprises those parts of the respiratory system through which air flows conceptually beginning on inhalation from the external environment at the nose and mouth and terminating in the alveoli it is generally used synonymously with respiratory tract to avoid sounding overly scientific from the mouth or nose inhaled air passes through the pharynx into the trachea where it separates into the left and right main bronchi at the carina situated at the level of the second thoracic vertebra the main bronchi then branch into large bronchioles one for each lobe of the lung within the lobes the bronchioles further subdivide some twenty times ending in clusters of alveoli the epithelial surfaces of the airway contain cilia inhaled particles adhere to mucus secreted by goblet cell s which is continuously driven outwards by the cilia the epithelium of the airway also secretes a watery fluid upon which the mucus can ride freely the production of this fluid is impaired by the disease cystic fibrosis macrophages in the airways help promote prophylaxis and prevent infection and contamination by engulfing bacteria and other inhaled particles certain conditions require tracheal intubation insertion of a tube to secure the patency openness of the airway airway device s are used to assist in tracheal intubation see also jet ventilation nasopharyngeal airway oropharyngeal airway external links http vam anest ufl edu airwaydevice the virtual airway device a free resource about airway devices including a video library category:respiratory system ar:مسلك هوائي cs:dýchací cesty pl:drogi oddechowe pt:via respiratória fi:hengitystiet

the hypodermis also called the hypoderm subcutaneous tissue or superficial fascia is the lowermost layer of the integumentary system in vertebrate s types of cells that are found in the hypodermis are fibroblast s adipose cells and macrophage s it is derived from the mesoderm but unlike the dermis it is not derived from the dermatome region of the mesoderm in arthropods the hypodermis is an epidermal layer of cells that secretes the chitin ous cuticle the term also refers to a layer of cells lying immediately below the epidermis of plants this cell is also used to supervise the outer skin from burns and other such articulates the hypodermis is used mainly for fat storage a layer of tissue that lies immediately below the dermis of vertebrate skin it is often referred to as subcutaneous tissue though this is a less precise and anatomically inaccurate term the hypodermis consists primarily of loose connective tissue and lobules of fat it contains larger blood vessels and nerves than those found in the dermis subcutaneous fat thumb subcutaneous fat is found just beneath the skin as opposed to visceral fat which is found in the peritoneal cavity subcutaneous fat can be measured using body fat caliper s giving a rough estimate of total body adiposity this fat aids in the process of homeostasis by forming a layer of insulation to slow heat loss hypothetical function during human evolution body fat is cited within the aquatic ape hypothesis as the result of adaptation to aquatic environments as a means of streamlining and insulation others have pointed out in response that the subcutaneous fat distribution in humans is more similar to a domesticated animal than an aquatic one and is nearly identical to that of other primates the subcutaneous fat of aquatic mammals and humans also seems to serve different uses

in medicine mastectomy is the medical term for the surgical removal of one or both breast s partially or completely mastectomy is usually done to treat breast cancer in some cases women and some men believed to be at high risk of breast cancer have the operation prophylactically that is to prevent cancer rather than treat it it is also the medical procedure carried out to remove breast cancer tissue in males alternatively certain patients can choose to have a wide local excision also known as a lumpectomy an operation in which a small volume of breast tissue containing the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue is removed to conserve the breast both mastectomy and lumpectomy are what are referred to as local therapies for breast cancer targeting the area of the tumor as opposed to systemic therapies such as chemotherapy hormonal therapy or immunotherapy traditionally in the case of breast cancer the whole breast was removed currently the decision to do the mastectomy is based on various factors including breast size number of lesions biologic aggressiveness of a breast cancer the availability of adjuvant radiation and the willingness of the patient to accept higher rates of tumor recurrences after lumpectomy and radiation outcome studies comparing mastectomy to lumpectomy with radiation have suggested that routine radical mastectomy surgeries will not always prevent later distant secondary tumors arising from micro metastases prior to discovery diagnosis and operation rates thumb mastectomy rates vary tremendously worldwide as was documented by the 2004 intergroup exemestane study an analysis of surgical techniques used in an international trial of adjuvant treatment among 4 700 women with early breast cancer in 37 countries the mastectomy rate was highest in central and eastern europe at 77 the usa had the second highest rate of mastectomy with 56 western and northern europe

a colostomy is a reversible surgical procedure in which a stoma is formed by drawing the healthy end of the large intestine or colon through an incision in the anterior abdominal wall and suturing it into place this opening in conjunction with the attached stoma appliance provides an alternative channel for feces to leave the body indications there are many reasons for this procedure some common reasons are a http www pedisurg com imagespteduc colostomy gif section of the colon has been removed e g due to colon cancer requiring a total mesorectal excision diverticulitis injury etc so that it is no longer possible for feces to exit via the anus a portion of the colon or large intestine has been operated upon and needs to be rested until it is healed in this case the colostomy is often temporary and is usually reversed at a later date leaving the patient with a small scar in place of the stoma children undergoing surgery for extensive pelvic tumor s commonly are given a colostomy in preparation for surgery to remove the tumor followed by reversal of the colostomy options placement of the stoma on the abdomen can occur at any location along the colon but the most common placement is on the lower left side near or in the sigmoid membrane wall other locations include the ascending transverse and descending sections of the colon types of colostomy loop colostomy this type of colostomy is usually used in emergencies and is a temporary and large stoma a loop of the bowel is pulled out onto the abdomen and held in place with an external device the bowel is then sutured to the abdomen and two openings are created in the one stoma one for stool and the other for mucus end colostomy a stoma is created from one end of the bowel

in human anatomy the groin areas are the two creases at the junction of the torso with the leg s on either side of the pubic area this is also known as the medial adductor compartment of the thigh a pulled groin muscle usually refers to a painful injury sustained by straining the hip adductor muscles these hip adductor muscles that make up the groin consist of the adductor brevis adductor longus adductor magnus gracilis and pectineus these groin muscles adduct the thigh bring the femur and knee closer to the body the groin is innervated by the obturator nerve except for the pectineus which is innervated by the femoral nerve this difference in innervation has caused some dispute whether or not the pectineus belongs to this groin and adduction group even though it still adducts the thigh the term is sometimes used as a euphemism for sex organ s since the names of the sex organs are taboo word s in some cultures for vascular surgeons the groin is the preferred site for incisions to enter a catheter into the vascular system in the groin underneath the skin are some lymph glands that play a role in the immune system these can be swollen due to certain diseases the most common cause being a simple infection and less likely cancer references category:human anatomy category:euphemisms gn:tambeypy ca:engonal cs:tříslo cy:arffed da:lyske de:leistenregion es:ingle eo:ingveno eu:iztai fr:aine io:inguino it:regione inguinale he:מפשעה nl:lies (anatomie) ja:鼠蹊部 nn:lyske oc:engue pt:virilha ru:пах simple:groin fi:nivunen sv:ljumske tl:singit (anatomiya) zh:鼠蹊部

hemodynamics or haemodynamics in british english meaning literally blood movement is the study of blood flow or the circulation all animal cells require oxygen o sub 2 sub for the conversion of carbohydrates fats and proteins into carbon dioxide co sub 2 sub water and energy in a process known as aerobic respiration the circulatory system functions to transport the blood to deliver o sub 2 sub nutrients and chemicals to the cells of the body to ensure their health and proper function and to remove the cellular waste product s the circulatory system is a connected series of tubes which includes the heart the arteries the microcirculation and the vein s the heart is the driver of the circulatory system generating cardiac output co by rhythmically contracting and relaxing this creates changes in regional pressures and combined with a complex valvular system in the heart and the veins ensures that the blood moves around the circulatory system in one direction the beating of the heart generates pulsatile blood flow which is conducted into the arteries across the micro circulation and eventually back via the venous system to the heart the aorta the main artery leaves the left heart and proceeds to divide into smaller and smaller arteries until they become arteriole s and eventually capillaries where oxygen transfer occurs the capillaries connect to venule s into which the deoxygenated blood passes from the cells back into the blood and the blood then travels back through the network of veins to the right heart the micro circulation the arterioles capillaries and venules constitutes most of the area of the vascular system and is the site of the transfer of o sub 2 sub glucose and enzyme substrate s into the cells the venous system returns the de oxygenated blood to the right heart where it is pumped into

in human anatomy the ureters are muscular tubes that propel urine from the kidney s to the urinary bladder in the adult the ureters are usually long and 3 4 mm in diameter in humans the ureters arise from the renal pelvis on the medial aspect of each kidney before descending towards the bladder on the front of the psoas major muscle the ureters cross the pelvic brim near the bifurcation of the iliac arteries which they run over this is a common site for the impaction of kidney stones the others beings the ureterovesical valve and the pelviureteric junction where the ureter joins the renal pelvis in the renal hilum the ureters run posteroinferiorly on the lateral walls of the pelvis and then curve anteriormedially to enter the bladder through the back at the vesicoureteric junction running within the wall of the bladder for a few centimetres the backflow of urine is prevented by valves known as ureterovesical valves in females the ureters pass through the mesometrium and under the uterine arteries on the way to the urinary bladder ureters are also found in all other amniote species although different ducts fulfill the same role in amphibian s and fish histology thumb the ureteric lumen is star shaped like the bladder it is lined with transitional epithelium and contains layers of smooth muscle thereby being under autonomic control the epithelial cells of the ureter are stratified in many layers are normally round in shape but become squamous flat when stretched the lamina propria is thick and elastic as it is important that it is impermeable there are two spiral layers of smooth muscle in the ureter wall an inner loose spiral and an outer tight spiral the inner loose spiral is sometimes described as longitudinal and the outer as circular this is the opposite to the situation

in the heart a ventricle is a one of two large and fit right and left chambers that collect and expel blood received from an atrium towards the peripheral beds within the body and lungs the atria an adjacent upper heart chamber that is smaller than a ventricle primes the pump interventricular means between two or more ventricles for example the interventricular septum while intraventricular means within one ventricle for example an intraventricular block in a four chambered heart such as that in human s there are two ventricles the right ventricle pumps blood into the pulmonary circulation to for the lung s and the left ventricle pumps blood into the systemic circulation through the aorta systemic circulation see double circulatory system for details ventricles have thicker walls than atria and must allow and withstand higher incoming and outgoing blood pressure s the physiologic load on the ventricles requiring pumping of blood throughout the body and lungs is much greater than the pressure generated by the atria to fill the ventricles further the left ventricle has thicker walls than the right because it needs to pump blood to most of the body while the right ventricle fills only the lungs thumb image no longer available the mass of the left ventricle as estimated by magnetic resonance imaging averages 143 g 38 4 g with a range of 87 224 g in systole and diastole during systole the ventricles contract pumping blood through the body during diastole the ventricles relax and fill with blood again volumes in cardiology the performance of the ventricles are measured with several volumetric parameters including end-diastolic volume edv end-systolic volume esv stroke volume sv and ejection fraction e sub f sub thumb of various events of a cardiac cycle showing left ventricular volume as a red trace br clear all dimensthe headfyrbhrewfbrt is a uglr are also commonly measured in terms of

thumb the thorax from greek θώραξ thorax breastplate cuirass corslet is a division of an animal s body that lies between the head and the abdomen in mammal s the thorax is the region of the body formed by the sternum the thoracic vertebra e and the rib s it extends from the neck to the diaphragm and does not include the upper limb s the heart and the lung s reside in the thoracic cavity as well as many blood vessel s the inner organs are protected by the rib cage and the sternum in insect s and the extinct trilobite s the thorax is one of the three main divisions or tagmata of the creatures body each of which is in turn composed of multiple segments it is the area where the wings and legs attach in insects or an area of multiple articulating plates in trilobites in most insects the thorax itself is composed of three segments the prothorax the mesothorax and the metathorax in extant insects the prothorax never has wings though legs are always present in adults wings when present are restricted to at least the mesothorax and typically also the metathorax though the wings may be reduced or modified on either or both segments in the apocrita n hymenoptera the first abdominal segment is fused to the metathorax where it forms a structure known as the propodeum accordingly in these insects the functional thorax is composed of four segments and is therefore typically called the mesosoma to distinguish it from the thorax of other insects each thoracic segment in an insect is further subdivided into various parts the most significant of which are the dorsal portion the notum the lateral portion the pleuron one on each side and the ventral portion the sternum in some insects each of

thumb bronchoscopy is a technique of visualizing the inside of the airway s for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes an instrument bronchoscope is inserted into the airways usually through the nose or mouth or occasionally through a tracheostomy this allows the practitioner to examine the patients airways for abnormalities such as foreign bodies bleeding tumor s or inflammation specimens may be taken from inside the lungs the construction of bronchoscopes ranges from rigid metal tubes with attached lighting devices to flexible optical fiber instruments with realtime video equipment history a german gustav killian performed the first bronchoscopy in 1897 from then until the 1970s rigid bronchoscopes were used exclusively killian used rigid bronchoscopy to remove a pork bone the procedure was done in an awake patient using topical cocaine as a local anesthetic an american chevalier jackson refined the rigid bronchoscope in the 1920s using this rigid tube to visually inspect the trachea and mainstem bronchi a japanese shigeto ikeda invented the flexible bronchoscope in 1966 the flexible scope initially employed fiberoptic bundles requiring an external light source for illumination these scopes had outside diameters of approximately 5 mm to 6 mm with an ability to flex 180 degress and to extend 120 degrees allowing entry into lobar and segmental bronchi more recently fiberoptic scopes have been replaced by bronchoscopes with a charge coupled device ccd video chip located at their distal extremity types rigid rigid bronchoscopy is used for retrieving foreign objects massive hemoptysis defined as loss of 600 ml of blood in 24 hours is a medical emergency and should be addressed with initiation of intravenous fluids and examination with rigid bronchoscopy the larger lumen of the rigid bronchoscope versus the narrow lumen of the flexible bronchoscope allows for therapeutic approaches such as electrocautery to help control the bleeding flexible fiberoptic

the colon is the last part of the digestive system in most vertebrate s it extracts water and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the site in which flora aided largely bacteria fermentation of unabsorbed material occurs unlike the small intestine the colon does not play a major role in absorption of foods and nutrients however the colon does absorb water potassium and some fat soluble vitamins in mammal s the colon consists of four sections the ascending colon the transverse colon the descending colon and the sigmoid colon the proximal colon usually refers to the ascending colon and transverse colon the colon cecum and rectum make up the large intestine anatomy the location of the parts of the colon are either in the abdominal cavity or behind it in the retroperitoneum the colon in those areas is fixed in location arterial supply to the colon comes from branches of the superior mesenteric artery sma and inferior mesenteric artery ima flow between these two systems communicates via a marginal artery that runs parallel to the colon for its entire length historically it has been believed that the arc of riolan or the meandering mesenteric artery of moskowitz is a variable vessel connecting the proximal sma to the proximal ima that can be extremely important if either vessel is occluded however recent studies conducted with improved imaging technology have questioned the actual existence of this vessel with some experts calling for the abolition of the terms from future medical literature venous drainage usually mirrors colonic arterial supply with the inferior mesenteric vein draining into the splenic vein and the superior mesenteric vein joining the splenic vein to form the hepatic portal vein that then enters the liver lymphatic drainage from the entire colon and proximal two thirds of the rectum is to the paraaortic lymph node s that then drain into the cisterna chyli the lymph

the uterus from latin uterus womb belly plural uteruses or uteri or womb is a major female hormone responsive reproductive sex organ of most mammal s including human s one end the cervix opens into the vagina while the other is connected to one or both fallopian tubes depending on the species it is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation usually developing completely in placental mammals such as humans and partially in marsupial s such as kangaroo s and opossum s two uteruses usually form initially in a female fetus and in placental mammals they may partially or completely fuse into a single uterus depending on the species in many species with two uteruses only one is functional humans and other higher primate s such as chimpanzee s along with horse s usually have a single completely fused uterus although in some individuals the uteruses may not have completely fused the term uterus is used consistently within the medical and related professions while the germanic derived term womb is also common in everyday usage in the english language most animals that lay eggs such as bird s and reptile s have an oviduct instead of a uterus in monotreme s mammals which lay eggs and include the platypus either the term uterus or oviduct is used to describe the same organ but the egg does not develop a placenta within the mother and thus does not receive further nourishment after formation and fertilization marsupials have two uteruses each of which connect to a lateral vagina and which both use a third middle vagina which functions as the birth canal marsupial embryo s form a choriovitelline placenta which can be thought of as something between a monotreme egg and a true placenta in which the eggs yolk sac supplies a large part

a fontanelle or fontanel is an anatomical feature on an infants skull anatomy fontanelles are soft spots on a babys head which during birth enable the bony plates of the skull to flex allowing the childs head to pass through the birth canal the ossification of the bones of the skull cause the fontanelles to close over by a childs second birthday the closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium other than the anterior and posterior fontanelles the mastoid fontanelle and the sphenoidal fontanelle are also significant the skull of a newborn consists of five main bones two frontal bone s two parietal bone s and one occipital bone these are joined by fibrous sutures which allow movement that facilitates childbirth and brain growth at birth the skull features a small posterior fontanelle an open area covered by a tough membrane where the two parietal bones adjoin the occipital bone at the lambda this fontanelle usually closes during the first several months of an infants life this is called intramembranous ossification the mesenchymal connective tissue turns into bone tissue the much larger diamond shaped anterior fontanelle where the two frontal and two parietal bones join generally remains open until the child is about two years of age however in cleidocranial dysostosis it is often late in closing or may never close the anterior fontanelle is useful clinically examination of an infant includes palpating the anterior fontanelle two smaller fontanelles are located on each side of the head more anteriorly the sphenoidal between the sphenoid parietal temporal and frontal bones and more posteriorly the mastoid between the temporal occipital and parietal bones clinical significance a sunken fontanelle indicates dehydration whereas a very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised intracranial pressure the fontanelle may pulsate and although the precise cause of this is not known it is perfectly normal

right in tetrapod anatomy lumbar is an adjective that means of or pertaining to the abdominal segment of the torso between the diaphragm and the sacrum pelvis the lumbar region is sometimes referred to as the lower spine in human anatomy the five vertebrae in the lumbar region of the back are the largest and strongest in the movable part of the spinal column and can be distinguished by the absence of a foramen in the transverse process and by the absence of facets on the sides of the body in most mammal s the lumbar region of the spine curves outward the actual spinal cord medulla spinalis terminates between vertebrae one and two of this series called l1 and l2 the nervous tissue that extends below this point are individual strands that collectively form the cauda equina in between each lumbar vertebra a nerve root exits and these nerve roots come together again to form the largest single nerve in the human body the sciatic nerve the sciatic nerve runs through the back of each leg and into the feet this is why a disorder of the low back that affects a nerve root such as a spinal disc herniation can cause pain that radiates along the sciatic nerve sciatica down into the foot there are several muscle s in the low back that assist with rotation flexibility and strength these muscles are susceptible to injury especially while lifting heavy objects or lifting while twisting a low back muscle strain can be extremely painful but will usually heal within a few days or weeks the lumbar portion of the spine bears the most body weight and also provides the most flexibility a combination that makes it susceptible to injury and wear and tear over time this is why low back pain is so prevalent see also back belt s car seat and lumbar

a fontanelle or fontanel is an anatomical feature on an infants skull anatomy fontanelles are soft spots on a babys head which during birth enable the bony plates of the skull to flex allowing the childs head to pass through the birth canal the ossification of the bones of the skull cause the fontanelles to close over by a childs second birthday the closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium other than the anterior and posterior fontanelles the mastoid fontanelle and the sphenoidal fontanelle are also significant the skull of a newborn consists of five main bones two frontal bone s two parietal bone s and one occipital bone these are joined by fibrous sutures which allow movement that facilitates childbirth and brain growth at birth the skull features a small posterior fontanelle an open area covered by a tough membrane where the two parietal bones adjoin the occipital bone at the lambda this fontanelle usually closes during the first several months of an infants life this is called intramembranous ossification the mesenchymal connective tissue turns into bone tissue the much larger diamond shaped anterior fontanelle where the two frontal and two parietal bones join generally remains open until the child is about two years of age however in cleidocranial dysostosis it is often late in closing or may never close the anterior fontanelle is useful clinically examination of an infant includes palpating the anterior fontanelle two smaller fontanelles are located on each side of the head more anteriorly the sphenoidal between the sphenoid parietal temporal and frontal bones and more posteriorly the mastoid between the temporal occipital and parietal bones clinical significance a sunken fontanelle indicates dehydration whereas a very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised intracranial pressure the fontanelle may pulsate and although the precise cause of this is not known it is perfectly normal

the human male reproductive system or male genital system consists of a number of sex organs that are a part of the human reproductive process in the case of men these sex organs are located outside a man s body around the pelvic region the main male sex organs are the penis and the testes which produce semen and sperm which as part of sexual intercourse fertilize an ovum in a womans body and the fertilized ovum zygote gradually develops into a fetus which is later born as a child external genital organs penis the penis is the male copulatory organ it has a long shaft and enlarged bulbous shaped tip called the glans penis which supports the foreskin when the male becomes sexually aroused the penis becomes erect and ready for sexual activity erection occurs because sinuses within the erectile tissue of the penis become filled with blood the arteries of the penis are dilated while the veins are passively compressed so that blood flows into the erectile cartilage under pressure the penis expands during sexual reproduction or through sexual excitement and may eventually begin ejaculating where semen passes through the urinary tract and out of the meatus scrotum the scrotum is a pouch like structure that hangs behind the penis it holds and protects the testes it also contains numerous nerves and blood vessels during times of lower temperatures the muscle contracts and pulls the scrotum closer to the body giving it a wrinkled appearance internal genital organs epididymis the epididymis is a whitish mass of tightly coiled tubes cupped against the testicles it acts as a maturation and storage place for sperm before they pass into the vas deferens tubes that carry sperm to the ampullary gland and prostatic ducts vas deferens the vas deferens also known as the sperm duct is a thin tube

in some male mammal s the scrotum also referred to as the cod or scrot is a dual chambered protuberance of skin and muscle containing the testicle s and divided by a septum it is an extension of the abdomen and is located between the penis and anus in humans and some other mammals the base of the scrotum becomes covered with curly pubic hair s at puberty the scrotum is homologous to the labia majora in females function the function of the scrotum appears to be to keep the testes at a temperature slightly lower than that of the rest of the body for human beings the temperature should be one or two degrees celsius below body temperature 37 degrees celsius or 98 6 degrees fahrenheit higher temperatures may be damaging to sperm count the temperature is controlled by the scrotum moving the testicles closer to the abdomen when the ambient temperature is cold and further away when it is hot moving the testes away from the abdomen and increasing the exposed surface area allow a faster dispersion of excess heat this is done by means of contraction and relaxation of the cremaster muscle in the abdomen and the dartos fascia muscular tissue under the skin in the scrotum however this may not be the main function of the scrotum the volume of sperm produced by the testes is small 0 1 0 2 ml it has been suggested that if testes were situated within the abdominal cavity that they would be subjected to the regular changes in abdominal pressure that is exerted by the abdominal muscles this squeezing and relaxing would result in the more rapid emptying of the testes and epididymis of sperm before the spermatozoa were matured sufficiently for fertilization some mammals elephants and marine mammals for example do keep their testes

right in tetrapod anatomy lumbar is an adjective that means of or pertaining to the abdominal segment of the torso between the diaphragm and the sacrum pelvis the lumbar region is sometimes referred to as the lower spine in human anatomy the five vertebrae in the lumbar region of the back are the largest and strongest in the movable part of the spinal column and can be distinguished by the absence of a foramen in the transverse process and by the absence of facets on the sides of the body in most mammal s the lumbar region of the spine curves outward the actual spinal cord medulla spinalis terminates between vertebrae one and two of this series called l1 and l2 the nervous tissue that extends below this point are individual strands that collectively form the cauda equina in between each lumbar vertebra a nerve root exits and these nerve roots come together again to form the largest single nerve in the human body the sciatic nerve the sciatic nerve runs through the back of each leg and into the feet this is why a disorder of the low back that affects a nerve root such as a spinal disc herniation can cause pain that radiates along the sciatic nerve sciatica down into the foot there are several muscle s in the low back that assist with rotation flexibility and strength these muscles are susceptible to injury especially while lifting heavy objects or lifting while twisting a low back muscle strain can be extremely painful but will usually heal within a few days or weeks the lumbar portion of the spine bears the most body weight and also provides the most flexibility a combination that makes it susceptible to injury and wear and tear over time this is why low back pain is so prevalent see also back belt s car seat and lumbar

thumb cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr is an emergency procedure which is attempted in an effort to return life to a person in cardiac arrest it is indicated in those who are unresponsive with no breathing or only gasps it may be attempted both in and outside of a hospital cpr involves chest compressions at a rate of at least 100 per minute in an effort to create artificial circulation by manually pumping blood through the heart in addition the rescuer may provide breaths by either exhaling into their mouth or utilizing a device that pushes air into the lungs the process of externally providing ventilation is termed artificial respiration current recommendations place emphasis on high quality chest compressions over artificial respirations and a method involving only chest compressions is recommended for untrained rescuers cpr alone is unlikely to restart the heart its main purpose is to restore partial flow of oxygenated blood to the brain and heart it may delay tissue death and extend the brief window of opportunity for a successful resuscitation without permanent brain damage an administering of an electric shock to the heart termed defibrillation is usually needed to restore a viable or perfusing heart rhythm defibrillation is only effective for certain heart rhythms namely ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia rather than asystole or pulseless electrical activity cpr may however induce a shockable rhythm cpr is generally continued until the person regains return of spontaneous circulation rosc or is declared dead indications cpr is indicated for any person who is unresponsive with no breathing or only gasps as breathing as it is most likely that they are in cardiac arrest methods thumb in 2010 the american heart association and international liaison committee on resuscitation updated their cpr guidelines the importance of high quality cpr sufficient rate and depth without excessively ventilating was emphasized if at least 2 rescuers are present a ratio of 15 2 is

prefrontal redirects here for the skull bone see prefrontal bone for the reptile scale s see prefrontal scale the prefrontal cortex pfc is the anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain lying in front of the motor and premotor areas this brain region has been implicated in planning complex cognitive behaviors personality expression decision making and moderating correct social behavior the basic activity of this brain region is considered to be orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals the most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the prefrontal cortex area is executive function executive function relates to abilities to differentiate among conflicting thoughts determine good and bad better and best same and different future consequences of current activities working toward a defined goal prediction of outcomes expectation based on actions and social control the ability to suppress urges that if not suppressed could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes many authors have indicated an integral link between a persons personality and the functions of the prefrontal cortex definition there are three possible ways to define the prefrontal cortex as the granular frontal cortex as the projection zone of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus as that part of the frontal cortex whose electrical stimulation does not evoke movementsthe prefrontal cortex has been defined based on cytoarchitectonics by the presence of a cortical granular layer iv it is not entirely clear who first used this criterion many of the early cytoarchitectonic researchers restricted the use of the term prefrontal to a much smaller region of cortex including the gyrus rectus and the gyrus rostralis campbell 1905 g. e. smith 1907 brodmann 1909 von economo and koskinas 1925 in 1935 however jacobsen used the term prefrontal to distinguish granular prefrontal areas from agranular motor and premotor areas in terms of brodmann areas the prefrontal cortex traditionally includes areas

in the central nervous system the subarachnoid cavity subarachnoid space is the interval between the arachnoid membrane and pia mater it is occupied by spongy tissue consisting of trabeculæ delicate connective tissue filaments that extend from the arachnoid mater and blend into the pia mater and intercommunicating channels in which the cerebrospinal fluid is contained this cavity is small on the surface of the hemispheres of the brain on the summit of each gyrus the pia mater and the arachnoid are in close contact but in the sulci between the gyri triangular spaces are left in which the subarachnoid trabecular tissue is found whilst the pia mater closely follows the surface of the brain and dips into the sulci the arachnoid bridges across them from gyrus to gyrus at certain parts of the base of the brain the arachnoid is separated from the pia mater by wide intervals which communicate freely with each other and are named subarachnoid cisternæ in these the subarachnoid tissue is less abundant the subarachnoid space is the location of the interface between the vascular tissue and the cerebrospinal fluid and is active in the blood brain barrier the arachnoid mater continues down the spinal cord too and the subarachnoid layer with it it serves a similar function in the spinal cord as it does in the brain see also subarachnoid hemorrhage epidural space external links http instruct uwo ca anatomy 530 sagsin gif diagram at uwo ca category:meninges de:subarachnoidalraum it:spazio subaracnoideo nl:subarachnoïdale ruimte ja:クモ膜下腔 pl:przestrzeń podpajęczynówkowa pt:espaço subaracnóideo ru:субарахноидальное пространство sv:subaraknoidal subarachnoid space was a san francisco, california based psychedelic rock band founded in 1996 by mason jones the owner of the independent music label charnel music they relocated to portland oregon where they continued to perform tour and release albums most recently completed a fall tour of the us with the italian group ovo in september october 2009 before disbanding on august 13th 2010 this

chondrolaryngoplasty commonly called tracheal shave is a surgical procedure in which the thyroid cartilage is reduced in size by shaving down the cartilage through an incision in the throat generally to aid trans women in achieving a passable female appearance and occasionally on cisgender men and women who are uncomfortable with the girth of their adams apple surgery after an anesthetic local or general depending on whether or not it is the only surgery to be performed is administered to the patient a small horizontal incision is made on the bottom of the adams apple the muscles in the throat are then held apart with forceps and the protruding cartilage is shaved down with a scalpel thus making the throat appear smoother and less angular the incision is then closed with suture s and a red line will mark the incision for about six weeks little scarring occurs in most cases because the surgeon will usually make the incision in one of the minuscule folds of skin that cover the adams apple the surgery is usually outpatient unless it is combined with other surgeries that require hospital stay s particular care must be taken by the surgeon to not remove too much cartilage as doing so can reduce the structure of the trachea and cause breathing difficulties most surgeons who specialize in transsexual surgeries will perform it and some general plastic surgeons will as well it is likely the most common surgery performed on transsexual women other than sex reassignment surgery due to the proximity to the vocal folds there is the small possibility that they may be damaged during this type of surgery while the effects of a trachea shave on voice are minimal some patients will choose to undergo vocal surgery at the same time recovery most surgeons will tell the patient to frequently rub

in vertebrate anatomy the thyroid gland or simply the thyroid is one of the largest endocrine gland s in the body and is not to be confused with the parathyroid glands the thyroid gland is found in the neck inferior to below the thyroid cartilage also known as the adams apple and at approximately the same level as the cricoid cartilage the thyroid controls how quickly the body uses energy makes protein s and controls how sensitive the body should be to other hormones the thyroid gland participates in these processes by producing thyroid hormones the principal ones being triiodothyronine t sub 3 sub and thyroxine t sub 4 sub these hormones regulate the rate of metabolism and affect the growth and rate of function of many other systems in the body t sub 3 sub and t sub 4 sub are synthesized utilizing both iodine and tyrosine the thyroid gland also produces calcitonin which plays a role in calcium homeostasis the thyroid gland is controlled by thyroid-stimulating hormone tsh produced by the pituitary to be specific the anterior pituitary and thyrotropin-releasing hormone trh produced by the hypothalamus the thyroid gland gets its name from the greek word for shield after the shape of the related thyroid cartilage the most common problems of the thyroid gland consist of an overactive thyroid gland referred to as hyperthyroidism and an underactive thyroid gland referred to as hypothyroidism anatomy the thyroid gland is a butterfly shaped organ and is composed of two cone like lobes or wings lobus dexter right lobe and lobus sinister left lobe connected via the isthmus the organ is situated on the anterior side of the neck lying against and around the larynx and trachea reaching posteriorly the oesophagus and carotid sheath it starts cranially at the oblique line on the thyroid cartilage just below the laryngeal prominence or adams apple and

thumb bronchoscopy is a technique of visualizing the inside of the airway s for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes an instrument bronchoscope is inserted into the airways usually through the nose or mouth or occasionally through a tracheostomy this allows the practitioner to examine the patients airways for abnormalities such as foreign bodies bleeding tumor s or inflammation specimens may be taken from inside the lungs the construction of bronchoscopes ranges from rigid metal tubes with attached lighting devices to flexible optical fiber instruments with realtime video equipment history a german gustav killian performed the first bronchoscopy in 1897 from then until the 1970s rigid bronchoscopes were used exclusively killian used rigid bronchoscopy to remove a pork bone the procedure was done in an awake patient using topical cocaine as a local anesthetic an american chevalier jackson refined the rigid bronchoscope in the 1920s using this rigid tube to visually inspect the trachea and mainstem bronchi a japanese shigeto ikeda invented the flexible bronchoscope in 1966 the flexible scope initially employed fiberoptic bundles requiring an external light source for illumination these scopes had outside diameters of approximately 5 mm to 6 mm with an ability to flex 180 degress and to extend 120 degrees allowing entry into lobar and segmental bronchi more recently fiberoptic scopes have been replaced by bronchoscopes with a charge coupled device ccd video chip located at their distal extremity types rigid rigid bronchoscopy is used for retrieving foreign objects massive hemoptysis defined as loss of 600 ml of blood in 24 hours is a medical emergency and should be addressed with initiation of intravenous fluids and examination with rigid bronchoscopy the larger lumen of the rigid bronchoscope versus the narrow lumen of the flexible bronchoscope allows for therapeutic approaches such as electrocautery to help control the bleeding flexible fiberoptic

thumb and marked jugular venous distension external jugular vein marked by an arrow thumb the jugular venous pressure jvp sometimes referred to as jugular venous pulse is the indirectly observed pressure over the venous system it can be useful in the differentiation of different forms of heart and lung disease classically three upward deflections and two downward deflections have been described the upward deflections are the a atrial contraction c ventricular contraction and resulting bulging of tricuspid into the right atrium during isovolumic systole and v atrial venous filling the downward deflections of the wave are the x the atrium relaxes and the tricuspid valve moves downward and the y descent filling of ventricle after tricuspid opening method visualization thumb the patient is positioned under 45 and the filling level of the jugular vein determined visualize the internal jugular vein when looking for the pulsation in healthy people the filling level of the jugular vein should be less than 3 centimetre s above the sternal angle a pen light can aid in discerning the jugular filling level by providing tangential light the jvp is easiest to observe if one looks along the surface of the sternocleidomastoid muscle as it is easier to appreciate the movement relative to the neck when looking from the side as opposed to looking at the surface at a 90 degree angle like judging the movement of an automobile from a distance it is easier to see the movement of an automobile when it is crossing ones path at 90 degrees i e moving left to right or right to left as opposed to coming toward one pulse s in the jvp are rather hard to observe but trained cardiologists do try to discern these as signs of the state of the right atrium differentiation from the carotid pulse the jvp and carotid pulse

a tendon or sinew is a tough band of fibrous connective tissue that usually connects muscle to bone and is capable of withstanding tension tendons are similar to ligament s and fasciae as they are all made of collagen except that ligaments join one bone to another bone and fasciae connect muscles to other muscles tendons and muscles work together and can only exert a pulling force structure normal healthy tendons are mostly composed of parallel arrays of collagen fibres closely packed together the dry mass of normal tendons which makes up about 30 of the total mass with water is composed of about 86 collagen 2 elastin 1 5 proteoglycans and 0 2 inorganic components such as copper manganese and calcium the collagen portion is made up of 97 98 type i collagen with small amounts of other types of collagen these include type ii collagen in the cartilaginous zones type iii collagen in the reticulin fibres of the vascular walls type ix collagen type iv collagen in the basement membranes of the capillaries type v collagen in the vascular walls and type x collagen in the mineralized fibrocartilage near the interface with the bone collagen fibres coalesce into macroaggregates after secretion from the cell the terminal peptides are cleaved by procollagen n and c proteinases and the tropocollagen molecules spontaneously assemble into insoluble fibrils a collagen molecule is about 300 amp nbsp nm long and 1 2 amp nbsp nm wide and the diameter of the fibrils that are formed can range from 50 500 amp nbsp nm in tendons the fibrils then assemble further to form fascicles which are about 10 mm in length with a diameter of 50 300 μm and finally into a tendon fibre with a diameter of 100 500 μm groups of fascicles are bounded

in medicine cholestasis is a condition where bile cannot flow from the liver to the duodenum the two basic distinctions are an obstructive type of cholestasis where there is a mechanical blockage in the duct system such as can occur from a gallstone or malignancy and metabolic types of cholestasis which are disturbances in bile formation that can occur because of genetic defects or acquired as a side effect of many medications normal bile formation bile formation is a secretory function of the liver it begins in bile canaliculi that form between two adjacent surfaces of liver cells hepatocyte s similar to the terminal branches of a tree the canaliculi join each other to form larger and larger structures sometimes referred to as canals of hering which themselves join to form small bile ductules that have an epithelial surface the ductules join to form bile duct s that eventually form either the right main hepatic duct that drains the right lobe of the liver and the left main hepatic duct draining the left lobe of the liver the two ducts join to form the common hepatic duct which in turn joins the cystic duct from the gall bladder to give the common bile duct this duct then enters the duodenum at the ampulla of vater etiology abdominal mass e g cancer biliary atresia and other pediatric liver diseases biliary trauma congenital anomalies of the biliary tract gallstone s intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (obstetric cholestasis) primary biliary cirrhosis an autoimmune disorder primary sclerosing cholangitis associated with inflammatory bowel disease some drugs e g flucloxacillin and erythromycin histopathology under a microscope the individual hepatocytes will have a brownish green stippled appearance within the cytoplasm representing bile that cannot get out of the cell canalicular bile plugs between individual hepatocytes or within bile ducts may also be seen representing bile that has been excreted from the hepatocytes but cannot go any further due to the obstruction

a hernia is the protrusion of an organ or the fascia of an organ through the wall of the cavity that normally contains it a hiatal hernia occurs when the stomach protrudes into the mediastinum through the esophageal opening in the diaphragm by far the most common herniae develop in the abdomen when a weakness in the abdominal wall evolves into a localized hole or defect through which adipose tissue or abdominal organs covered with peritoneum may protrude another common hernia involves the spinal discs and causes sciatica herniae may or may not present either with pain at the site a visible or palpable lump or in some cases by more vague symptoms resulting from pressure on an organ which has become stuck in the hernia sometimes leading to organ dysfunction fatty tissue usually enters a hernia first but it may be followed by or accompanied by an organ most of the time herniae develop when pressure in the compartment of the residing organ is increased and the boundary is weak or weakened weakening of containing membranes or muscles is usually congenital which explains part of the tendency of herniae to run in families and increases with age for example degeneration of the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc but it may be on the basis of other illnesses such as ehlers-danlos syndrome or marfan syndrome stretching of muscles during pregnancy losing weight in obese people etc or because of scars from previous surgery many conditions chronically increase intra abdominal pressure pregnancy ascites copd dyschezia benign prostatic hypertrophy and hence abdominal hernias are very frequent increased intracranial pressure can cause parts of the brain to herniate through narrowed portions of the cranial cavity or through the foramen magnum increased pressure on the intervertebral discs as produced by heavy lifting or lifting with improper technique increases the risk of herniation classification

an arterial blood gas abg is a blood test that is performed using blood from an artery it involves puncturing an artery with a thin needle and syringe and drawing a small volume of blood the most common puncture site is the radial artery at the wrist but sometimes the femoral artery in the groin or other sites are used the blood can also be drawn from an arterial catheter the test is used to determine the ph of the blood the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen and the bicarbonate level many blood gas analyzers will also report concentrations of lactate hemoglobin several electrolyte s oxyhemoglobin carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin abg testing is mainly used in pulmonology to determine gas exchange levels in the blood related to lung function but has a variety of applications in other areas of medicine combinations of disorders can be complex and difficult to interpret so calculators nomograms and rules of thumb are commonly used extraction and analysis arterial blood for blood gas analysis is usually extracted by a phlebotomist nurse or respiratory therapist blood is most commonly drawn from the radial artery because it is easily accessible can be compressed to control bleeding and has less risk for occlusion the femoral artery or less often the brachial artery is also used especially during emergency situations or with children blood can also be taken from an arterial catheter already placed in one of these arteries the syringe is pre packaged and contains a small amount of heparin to prevent coagulation or needs to be heparinised by drawing up a small amount of heparin and squirting it out again once the sample is obtained care is taken to eliminate visible gas bubbles as these bubbles can dissolve into the sample and cause inaccurate results the sealed syringe is taken to a blood gas analyzer if the sample cannot

spondylolisthesis describes the anterior displacement of a vertebra or the vertebral column in relation to the vertebrae below it was first described in 1782 by belgian obstetrician dr herbinaux he reported a bony prominence anterior to the sacrum that obstructed the vagina of a small number of patients the term spondylolisthesis was coined in 1854 from the greek σπονδυλος vertebra and ὁλισθος slipperiness a slip the variant listhesis resulting from misdivision of this compound word is sometimes applied in conjunction with scoliosis these slips occur most commonly in the lumbar spine a hangmans fracture is a specific type of spondylolisthesis where the c1 vertebra is displaced anteriorly relative to the c2 vertebra due to fracture s of the c2 vertebras pedicles developmental anatomy in the late 1890s several cadaver studies demonstrated the characteristic pars defect of isthmic spondylolisthesis leading to many different theories concerning the etiology of the defect the first theory proposed a failure of ossification during embryo nic development leading to a pars defect at birth which then progressed to an isthmic slip after the infant began ambulating following the development of the roentgenogram in 1895 population x-ray studies showed that isthmic spondylolisthesis is in fact quite common a population study by fredrickson et al demonstrated that the pars defect began to appear around age six and became progressively more common until age 16 after age 16 the incidence fell and rarely developed after adolescence this study confirmed that the pars defect is the result of a defect in the cartilaginous anlage of a vertebra but not apparent at birth it is currently thought that the defect develops from small stress fractures that fail to heal and form a chronic nonunion there have been reports that the defect is more common among athletes who participate in sports with repeated hyperextension such as

light headedness is a common and often unpleasant sensation of dizziness and or feeling that one may be about to  faint which may be transient recurrent or occasionally chronic in some cases the individual may feel as though his or her head is weightless the individual may also feel as though the room is spinning or moving vertigo most causes of dizziness are not serious and either cure themselves quickly or are easily treated keeping a sense of balance requires the brain to process a variety of information from the eyes the nervous system and the inner ears however if the brain cant process signals from all of these locations if the messages are contradictory or if the sensory systems arent functioning properly an individual may experience dizziness and loss of balance causes light headedness can be simply an indication of a temporary shortage of blood or oxygen to the brain due to a drop in blood pressure rapid dehydration from vomiting diarrhea or fever or from playing a wind instrument other causes are low blood sugar hyperventilation panic attacks and anaemia it can also be a symptom of many other conditions some of them serious such as heart problems including abnormal heart rhythm or heart attack and also stroke bleeding and shock if any of these serious disorders is present the individual will usually have additional symptoms such as chest pain a feeling of a racing heart loss of speech or change in vision many people especially as they age experience light headedness if they arise too quickly from a lying or seated position light headedness often accompanies the flu hypoglycaemia common cold or allergies dizziness could be provoked by the use of antihistamine drugs like xyzal levocetirizine or by some antibiotics or ssri s treatment treatment for light headedness depends on the cause or underlying

hemoperitoneum sometimes also hematoperitoneum is the presence of blood in the peritoneal cavity the blood accumulates in the space between the inner lining of the abdominal wall and the internal abdominal organs hemoperitoneum is generally classified as a surgical emergency in most cases urgent laparotomy is needed to identify and control the source of the bleeding in selected cases careful observation may be permissible the abdominal cavity is highly distensible and may easily hold greater than five liters of blood or more than the entire circulating blood volume for an average sized individual therefore large scale or rapid blood loss into the abdomen will reliably induce hemorrhagic shock and may untreated rapidly lead to death causes causes of hemoperitoneum include penetrating trauma blunt trauma most commonly injuries to solid organs such as the liver and spleen vascular accidents such as rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm iliac aneurysm or splenic aneurysm bleeding due to a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or uterine rupture less commonly bleeding due to a perforated gastric ulcer bleeding due to rupture of an intra abdominal neoplasm e g hepatoblastoma disseminated intravascular coagulation diagnosis hemoperitoneum can be reliably diagnosed with the following examinations focused assessment with sonography for trauma fast paracentesis or diagnostic peritoneal lavage computed tomography diagnostic laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy treatment classically hemoperitoneum was an indication for emergency surgery to locate the source of bleeding the method of control depends on the source of blood loss vascular bleeding i e from a blood vessel would be treated by clamping and ligation of the offending vessel or repair of the vessel in the case of major arteries such as the aorta or mesenteric arteries bleeding from the spleen most often requires splenectomy or removal of the spleen bleeding from the liver might be controlled by application of hemostatic sponges thrombin or more recently argon beam cauterization with modern diagnostic aids such as computed tomography ct

in some male mammal s the scrotum also referred to as the cod or scrot is a dual chambered protuberance of skin and muscle containing the testicle s and divided by a septum it is an extension of the abdomen and is located between the penis and anus in humans and some other mammals the base of the scrotum becomes covered with curly pubic hair s at puberty the scrotum is homologous to the labia majora in females function the function of the scrotum appears to be to keep the testes at a temperature slightly lower than that of the rest of the body for human beings the temperature should be one or two degrees celsius below body temperature 37 degrees celsius or 98 6 degrees fahrenheit higher temperatures may be damaging to sperm count the temperature is controlled by the scrotum moving the testicles closer to the abdomen when the ambient temperature is cold and further away when it is hot moving the testes away from the abdomen and increasing the exposed surface area allow a faster dispersion of excess heat this is done by means of contraction and relaxation of the cremaster muscle in the abdomen and the dartos fascia muscular tissue under the skin in the scrotum however this may not be the main function of the scrotum the volume of sperm produced by the testes is small 0 1 0 2 ml it has been suggested that if testes were situated within the abdominal cavity that they would be subjected to the regular changes in abdominal pressure that is exerted by the abdominal muscles this squeezing and relaxing would result in the more rapid emptying of the testes and epididymis of sperm before the spermatozoa were matured sufficiently for fertilization some mammals elephants and marine mammals for example do keep their testes

digestion is the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into smaller components that are more easily absorbed into a blood stream for instance digestion is a form of catabolism a breakdown of large food molecules to smaller ones in mammals food enters the mouth being chewed by teeth with chemical processing beginning with chemicals in the saliva from the salivary gland s this is called mastication then it travels down the esophagus into the stomach where hydrochloric acid kills most contaminating microorganisms and begins mechanical break down of some food e g denaturation of protein and chemical alteration of some the hydrochloric acid also has a low ph which is great for enzymes after some time typically an hour or two in humans 4 6 hours in dogs somewhat shorter duration in house cats the resulting thick liquid is called chyme chyme will go through the small intestine where 95 of absorption of nutrients occurs through the large intestine and are eliminated during defecation other organisms use different mechanisms to digest food digestive systems digestive systems take many forms there is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digestion external digestion was the first to evolve and most fungi still rely on it in this process enzyme s are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism where they break down an organic material and some of the products diffuse back to the organism later animal s evolved by rolling into a tube and acquiring internal digestion which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured and the chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled some organisms including nearly all spiders simply secrete biotoxins and digestive chemicals e g enzyme s into the extracellular environment prior to ingestion of the consequent soup in others once potential nutrients or food is inside
