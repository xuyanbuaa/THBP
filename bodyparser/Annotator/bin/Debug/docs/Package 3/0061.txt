Chief Complaint :
Transfer from Tewksbury State Hospital Hospital CMED CCU for neurologic compromise , at request of family for second opinion .
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
None
History of Present Illness :
30-year-old woman with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary .
At ChelseaWomens ' , about 04-25 , she developed pseudomonal urosepsis and vaginal bleeding from tumor extension/anti-coagulation .
She was transfered to AttleboroHospital after an arrest .
Her course was complicated by post-hypotensive coma as well as subarachnoid hemorrhages and intraparenchymal bleeds .
Neurologists at RIH felt she had a poor prognosis , but communication between the medical team and family was strained and transfer was arranged to Mediplex Rehab Hospital for a second opinion .
Her outside course in more detail:
Patient transferred from Women and Infants Hospital to RI Hospital 2016-04-25 with weaknes , vag bleeding x several days , fever 102.5 , hypotension , hypoxic 84% on 4L NC , tachypnic to 30 , with labs significant for lactate 6.3 , wbc <1.0 , plt 9 , hgb 8.9 , and INR greater than lab threshold .
Intubated for airway protection ( ABG 7.39/26.5/73.6 ) and placed on levophed .
.
Placed on Reynolds/vanc/fluc/gentamicin for neutropenic fever and thrush initially .
IVC filter placed 04-26 .
CT abdomen consistent with large necrotic pelvic mass - not sampled 02-12 coagulopathy .
04-27 results from Blood Cx from W+I :
04-24 PICC Bld Cx : pseudomonas Diaz to zosyn , cipro , cefepime , Tardugno -- staph epi- Gray to vanc
04-24 Peripheral Bld Cx : pseudomonas as above
04-24 Urine Cx : pseudomonas as above
Abx changed to vanc , zosyn , cipro , fluc , azith .
Pressors weaned off by 04-27 .
Completed 7 days of vanc/fluc , 13/14 days of cipro/zosyn .
Continued to have recurrent fevers .
.
Seen by Urology who did not change stents given severe coagulopathy and worsening renal function .
Found to be in DIC and supported with daily blood products .
Seen by heme and GCSF started .
Despite aggressive blood product repletion patient poorly responsive 02-12 alloimmunization .
Plt count 1 on 2016-04-29 .
Supported on TPN for nutrition then switched to tube feeds .
Developed renal failure with Cr peak of 2.9.
Seen by renal who felt was c/w ATN .
.
Head CT done 05-04 with bilateral SAH and L temporal parenchymal hematoma .
Also with multiple masses consistent with metastasis .
Placed on Dilantin .
Neurosurgery consulted .
Felt secondary to low platelets with no surgical intervention indicated .
.
Mult family meetings given poor prognosis .
Initially decided not to escilate care and make DNR 05-05 .
Then progressed to withdrawal of care 05-06 with plan to extubate 05-07 .
However there was dissent among neurologists about patient 's ability to recover from the SAH while awaiting family members and the patient was changed to full code .
Given 48 hours off sedation with out change in mental status ( last morphine was 2016-05-07 ) .
Transferred to Mediplex Rehab Hospital for further work up .
.
On arrival to the FICU the patient was intubated and non-sedated .

2016-05-11 MRI head:
FINDINGS :
The sagittal T1 images demonstrate several areas of high signal along the sulci bilaterally which could be secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhages .
There are several areas of hyperintensities at the convexity which could be intraaxial and could be related to hemorrhage within the metastatic lesions but in absence of gradient echo images , this could not be further confirmed .
A CT would help for further assessment if indicated .
There is increased signal seen in both basal ganglia region as well as along the rolandic region bilaterally which is suggestive of global hypoxic injury to the brain .
There are several areas of brain edema identified in the left frontal and parietal lobe and both temporal lobes , which are suspicious for areas of metastatic disease with surrounding edema .
There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift seen .
No herniation is identified .
Images through the skull base demonstrate soft tissue changes in the sphenoid sinus which could be due to retained secretions from intubation .
There is increased signal seen along the sulci on FLAIR images at the convexity which could be secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage .
A CT would help for further assessment and exclude proteinaceous material within the sulci .
Gadolinium-enhanced MRI would also help for further assessment .
.
pCXR 2016-05-11 5:01am:
FINDINGS :
No prior comparisons .
Tip of the ETT projects roughly 5 cm above the carina .
A right IJ central venous line is at the level of the mid SVC .
Tip of the NGT is below the edge of the image .
IVC filter and probable NU stent catheter on the left also noted .
Heart and mediastinum are unremarkable allowing for technique , no sizeable pneumothorax .
There is a somewhat wedge-shaped opacity at the right lung base which could represent aspiration or pneumonia .
No other confluent infiltrates are appreciated
.
pCXR 2016-05-11. 1:46pm:
1. Mild pulmonary edema .
2. Vague right lower lobe opacity most likely represents pulmonary edema though if opacity persistent after diuresis , aspiration and pneumonia will become considerations .
3. ETT 4 cm above the carina with NG tube advancement into the stomach .
.
EEG 2016-05-12:
Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing .
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy .
Medications , metabolic disturbances , and infection are among the most common causes .
Subarachnoid hemorrhage is another possible explanation .
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing , and there were no epileptiform features
.
Trans-thoracic echocardiogram 2016-05-12 :
The left atrium is normal in size .
Left ventricular wall thickness , cavity size , and systolic function are normal ( LVEF>55% ) .
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal .
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal .
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation .
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation .
There is no mitral valve prolapse .
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined .
There is no pericardial effusion .
IMPRESSION :
Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function .
No pericardial effusion .
.
pCXR 2016-05-13 :
Mild left lower perihilar opacification has improved , probably resolving edema .
There is more rightward mediastinal shift , suggesting new atelectasis in the right lung .
Enlargement of the right hilus could represent adenopathy .
Whether to pursue this would depend upon clinical circumstances .
Heart size normal .
ET tube in standard placement .
Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view .
No appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusions
.
pCXR 2016-05-14 :
Increasing opacification of the lungs could be due to mild pulmonary edema and multiple micrometastases , worsened slightly since 05-13 at 10:57 p.m.
Heart size is normal .
There is no pleural effusion .
The ET tube and right PICC line in standard placements .
Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view .
No pneumothorax .

Brief Hospital Course :
30 yo F with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary who presented to OSH 04-25 with pseudomonal urosepsis , vaginal bleeding from tumor extension/anti-coagulation .
Course complicated by sub arachnoid hemorrhages and intraparenchymal bleeds as well as potential hypotensive brain injury with poor prognosis per neurology .
Transferred here for second opinion on poor prognosis .
.
# Neurologic - The patient was seen by the Neurology consult service and underwent MRI head which revealed lesions suspicious for metastases , possible hemorrhages , and findings consistent with hypoxic brain injury .
EEG was performed and revealed encephalopathy .
The patient 's neurologic exam ( performed after sedation removed >48 hours ) revealed intact brainstem function without evidence of higher cortical activity .
She had some metabolic abnormalities which were corrected ( hypernatremia , hyperphosphatemia ) , but neurologic exam was unchanged .
A family meeting on 2016-05-13 was held and these findings communicated with the patient 's family .
Final neurologic assessment was that the patient was unlikely to regain meaningful neurologic functioning .
At the request of her family , she will be transferred closer to her home in Wyoming , to Women and
Infants hospital .
.
# Respiratory Failure - Pt arrived on pressure support ventilation , which was changed to Assist control to make patient more comfortable .
She was originally intubated for airway protection , and it is felt she could likely be weaned from the ventilator although she would be extremely high risk for aspiration .
Due to family request to move patient to a hospital closer to home , she will remain intubated until transfer , with plan to extubate upon arrival to Women and Infants hospital with initiation of full palliative care and compliance of DNI status .
.
# Fevers/Infection - Per outside hospital records , the patient grew pseudomonas from blood and urine .
At OSH , she was treated with 7 days of vancomycin , as well as 13 days ( of 14-day planned course ) of Ciprofloxacin and Zosyn .
She was intially continued on Cipro/Zosyn .
CXR 05-11 revealed ? pneumonia vs atelectasis at the R lung base .
Continues to spike fever .
Could have still seeding of nephrostomy tube .
Urology at OSH against pulling tube because coagulopathy and may not be able to replace .
Fevers also may be from head bleed , cancer , or drug .
She was continued on zosyn and vancomycin to complete a >14 day course .
She continued to have fevers .
Antibiotics were discontinued on 05-15 .
No further infectious course was identified and the fevers may have been due to underlying malignant process .
.
# Squamous Cell Cancer - unknown primary .
The patient was seen by the oncology consult service who contacted her outside hematologist Dr. Pauling .
Upon discussion with him it was noted that the patient had progression of her disease after systemic therapy with topotecan and cisplatin .
She then proceed to XRT with cisplatin which she was unable to tolerate this secondary to thrombocytopenia ( 40-50K ) .
Given this we were unable to offer her additional therapy. Hematology/Oncology service at Mediplex Rehab Hospital confirmed her grim prognosis and expective survival in terms of weeks to months with no further available treatment .
.
# h/o DVT - patient with head bleed which is contraindication to anti-coagulation .
IVC filter in place .
Patient was on pneumoboots while in hospital .
.
# Hypernatremia - Improved from OSH .
Total body volume overloaded .
Water Deficit 2.5 L .
She was continued on free H20 boluses and D5 1/2 NS and corrected .
.
# Acute Renal Failure - stable , likely 02-12 hypotension leading to ATN that is slowly improving .
.
# Access - R IJ changed sterilly over wire 05-01
.
# FEN - tube feeds are held in route in anticipation of extubation .
.
.
# Code Status :
After multiple discussion with family and the doctor accepting the patient at Women and Infants Hospital(  Dr . Pauling ) at RI .
She was made DNR/DNI and the plan is that she will be transferred to WIH and extubated there upon arrival with initiation of full palliative care .
The family understood this; all questions were answered and they wished to proceed .
They understand that there is no ICU at WIH and no further advanced pulmonary support can be offered .
