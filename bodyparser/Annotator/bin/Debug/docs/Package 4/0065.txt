CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Shortness of breath .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 71-year-old-female with asthma and a history of recent exacerbation of lower extremity edema who , at her baseline , gets short of breath walking across the room and sleeps on four pillows times several years .
She has reported that she has had upper respiratory symptoms times several days with increasing dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath , eventually at rest with marked wheezing .
She also has a cough with a small amount of white sputum .
At 3 a.m. on the day of admission , she became much worse and after several days of increasing her meter-dosed inhaler use , she call Emergency Medical Services which assessed her as having heart failure with elevated jugular venous distention and rales .
She received aspirin , Lasix 40 mg intravenously times two , 0.8 mg of nitroglycerin times four , plus morphine sulfate .
Her blood pressure was noted to be up to 220/110 .
She was taken to the The Hospital for Orthopedics Emergency Room where she was assessed as having asthma .
She then received continuous nebulizer treatments for approximately eight hours with minimal improvement .
She did receive intravenous nitroglycerin in the Emergency Room for blood pressure controlled to the 170s .
She initially received a treatment of BiPAP on arrival as she was barely able to speak .
She also received 80 mg of Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department .
She was never hypoxic but initially her arterial blood gas showed a respiratory acidosis with a PCO2 of 71 .
The patient does have a vague history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , but this is felt to be inaccurate .
She also received captopril 12.5 mg times one .
Recently , the patient has been treated with several steroid tapers .
Depending on the family , patient , and the OMR records , the exact duration of the most recent one was unclear .
It either ended in 2011-04-11 or continued through 2011-05-11 with use of Augmentin ; and , by report , lasted until 06-07 .
However , the family said the patient has been on steroids for several weeks .
The patient denies any exposure to smoke , animals , unusual dust or vapors , or other asthma triggers .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Asthma as a child which recurred in 2001 .
She takes an albuterol and Atrovent inhalers as well as Serevent and Flovent .
She has had multiple hospitalizations and has never been intubated .
She has had multiple prednisone tapers ( see History of Present Illness ) .
On prednisone or sometime after it was discontinued , depending on the version , the patient developed worsening lower extremity edema which has been a Vega problem for her and was started on dyazide as an outpatient .
Pulmonary function tests most recently in 2009-01-10 were not obstructive .
They showed an FVC of 91% of predicted , and a FEV1 of 104% of predicted , with a ratio of 114% .
In 2003 , there was 19% change of the FEV1 and an 11% change in the FVC with bronchodilators .
2. Mild hypertension , especially on prednisone .
3. Hypoplastic left lower extremity and hip repair at the age of five .
4. Polio .
5. Status post cesarean section .
6. History of zoster .
7. Past Discharge Summary mention a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , but the patient has never smoked .
8. Incontinent of both stool and urine .
9. Allergic rhinitis .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Brother and sister both have asthma .
Brother has diabetes mellitus .
There is no family history of coronary artery disease .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives on the first floor of her home with her daughter living upstairs .
There are several foster children also in the home that take care of her at times .

No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Dyazide 25/37.5 p.o. q.d. , as well as Atrovent , albuterol , and Flovent inhalers , and Swanson 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Serevent 2 puffs q.12h.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
On transfer , she also arrived on 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and reports p.r.n. Alka-Seltzer , sinus and NyQuil use .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Review of systems were notable for lower extremity edema which worsened in May .
She says she has had this intermittently with hot summers in the past .
She denies chest pain .
She does have chest tightness since two days ago , coinciding with her wheezing .
She had paroxysms of cough and shortness of breath which resolves with water and sitting up .
This is worse when she has asthma flares .
She denies a rash and any genitourinary symptoms .
She has had a constant runny nose and has had no sick contacts .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION :
Physical examination revealed afebrile , respiratory rate of 23 , heart rate of 113 , blood pressure 130s/90s .
In general , this was a female in moderate distress secondary to shortness of breath , spoke in short phrases and then in complete sentences as the night went on .
Head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat revealed oropharynx was moist .
There was no jugular venous distention .
There was no HDR .
Sclerae were anicteric .
Cardiovascular revealed she was tachycardic with a regular first heart sound and second heart sound .
Pulmonary revealed she had diffuse wheezes .
There were no rales .
She had reduced but adequate air movement .
The abdomen revealed normal active bowel sounds , soft , nontender , obese , and nondistended .
Extremities revealed left lower extremity was hypoplastic .
There was pitting edema on both sides of the lower extremities .
The right ankle was somewhat tender from this edema .
Neurologically , the patient was oriented to person , place , and time ; however , she was somewhat drowsy and at times was difficult to keep awake during conversations .
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION :
White blood cell count was 10.2 , hematocrit of 37.5 , platelets of 236 .
INR of 1.3 , PTT of 30.3 .
Urinalysis revealed 6 to 10 red blood cells , 0 to 2 white blood cells , 4 epithelial cells with Foley in place .
Urine culture later grew out contaminated specimen .
Differential with 72 polys , 16 lymphocytes , 4.6 monocytes , 6.3 eosinophils .
Chem-7 was notable for a bicarbonate of 31 and a glucose of 156 .
Arterial blood gas was 7.24/71/227 .
Creatine kinase was 243 , with a MB of 9 , and a troponin of less than 0.3.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING :
Chest x-ray showed low lung volumes but no evidence of congestive heart failure .
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 115 with a normal axis , intermittent Q wave in III; a wavy baseline .
The patient had a stress echocardiogram with a normal ejection fraction in 2007 .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. PULMONARY :
She was treated with albuterol and Atrovent continuous nebulizers and was weaned then to intermittent nebulizer treatments and then to her meter-dosed inhalers taking them q.4h. at the time of discharge .
She was continued on salmeterol and Flovent .
She was continued on Solu-Medrol 80 mg q.8h. then converted to prednisone at 60 mg p.o. q.d.
She was started on Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Serial arterial blood gases were followed after an arterial line was placed .
Her PCO2 gradually declined to the 48 range .
Despite episodes of somnolence the first night which were presumably due to having spent the entire night in the Emergency Department , she never became more hypercarbic , and her PCO2 trended to 48 by the time the arterial line was discontinued .
On the night of admission and thereafter , she was noted to have a very stridorous sounding breathing when the patient was asleep .
This would disappear whenever she was awake .
Her case was discussed with Ear/Nose/Throat and the Medical Intensive Care Unit attending .
She was given a trial of 80/20 mixed helium/oxygen to decrease the stridor but had minimal effect .
Ear/Nose/Throat recommended not considering this an airway problem unless she was stridorous while awake .
The patient was to arrange for Pulmonary and Medicine followup through her primary care physician upon discharge as she has not been seen in the Pulmonary Clinic in two years .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial creatine kinases , although these did rise to 816 .
MB was negative .
She was treated with captopril for hypertension , and this was switched to Norvasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. on discharge .
She had an echocardiogram which showed a hyperdynamic left ventricular of normal thickness and size , and no significant valvular disease .
She apparently did not have a cardiovascular component to her wheezing or shortness of breath ; however , she was to go home on Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. to help with lower extremity edema , as she experiences discomfort with this , and the team felt this may be a limiting factor with her prednisone compliance .
3. ENDOCRINE :
She was treated with a sliding-scale of regular insulin while she was in house .
She was given 500 mg p.o. q.d. of metformin to treat her steroid-induced diabetes on discharge .
This should be followed up by her primary care physician .
4. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
She was treated briefly with levofloxacin because of the gram-positive cocci in her sputum culture ; however , her symptoms were felt to be consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection , and levofloxacin was continued at the time of discharge .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Combivent meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h. weaning to albuterol meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h.
3. Salmeterol 2 puffs q.12h.
4. Flovent 220 mcg 2 puffs q.12h.
5. Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q.d. with taper .
6. Fentress 60 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Univasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d.
Dyazide was discontinued .
DISCHARGE STATUS :
Discharge services included visiting nursing which was to assess in her inhaler technique , monitor her fasting blood sugars , as well as her blood pressure , monitor her peak flows , and assess her mobility and activities of daily living at home .
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP :
She was also to seek the next available appointment with Dr. Jeanette Barr or to see another resident in the Saint Vincent Hospital Clinic if she cannot get an appointment within one week .
