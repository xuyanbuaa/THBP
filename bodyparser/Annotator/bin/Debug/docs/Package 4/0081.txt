Brief Hospital Course :
47 yo F w/ h/o steroid-induced hyperglycemia , SLE w/ h/o pericarditis , transverse myelitis w/ paraplegia and neurogenic bladder s/p urostomy w/ ileal conduit , h/o ureteropelvic stone and urosepsis , and h/o RLE DVT admitted 11-29 w/ left pyelo and right 8 mm proximal ureteral stone w/ right hydro s/p perc urostomy tube to relieve right hydro .
.
## GNR sepsis:
Upon admission , pt was febrile to 101.2 with U/A consistent with UTI .
A CT abd showed 8mm obstructing stone , hydro with stranding consistent with pylonephritis .
Her presentation was thought likely due to urosepsis given h/o foul smelling urine and in setting of stone w/ hydro + pyelo by CT. The patient went to IR on 2014-11-30 given evidence of right hydronephrosis on imaging for decompression and drainage. Upon admission , she was treated with Vancomycin and Gentamycin and Flagyl .
She was started on the MUST protocol with high dose steroids as well and a goal SVO2 >70% .
She was hypoxic requiring 3L nasal cannula O2 .
She subsequently developed hypotension with SBP in the 70s .
She was transferred to the CMED where the patient was continued on the MUST protocol with goais of CVP 10-12 , SVO2 greater than 70% .
The patient was bolused with NS and did not required pressors .
On the day after admission to the CMED , the patient was noted to have small oxygen requirement with 2L NC .
Repeat imaging revealed evidence of mild pulmonary congestion which was thought to account for the patient 's mild hypoxia .
Given that the patient had been maintaining a MAP of 60 without fluids or pressors , her goal CVP was decreased to >8 to avoid fluid overload .
The patient was continued on Vancomycin and Gentamycin while speciation and sensitivities were pending .
Ciprofloxacin was added on 2014-12-01 for synergy when surveillance cultures were found to be growing again GNR .
Gent and Cipro were then discontinued and changed to meropenem when blood culture sensitivities became available revealing GNR sensitive to Jacoby but resistant to both Gent and Cipro .
Additionaly surveillance cultures were drawn daily and the patient was transferred back to the floor with no subsequent pressor requirement .
Blood cltures from 11-30 grew KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE and 12-01 grew KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE and PROTEUS MIRABILIS both sensitive to the Meropenam which she had already been receiving .
Urine cultures from 11-30 grew STAPH AUREUS COAG + , and GRAM NEGATIVE RODS of two morphologies ( not further speciated ) .
She defervesed by 12-02 and remained clinically stable with normal blood pressures until the day of discharge .
At the time of discharge , blood cultures from 12-02 and 12-03 have no growth to date .
She received a midline on 12-04 with a goal of 16 days of further antibiotic treatment with Meropenam ( for a total of 3 weeks ) upon discharge back to the nursing home where she lives .
.
## Right hydronephrosis :
Given right sided hydronephrosis and GNR bactermeia , a percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed by IR 2014-11-30 .
The patient put out 1385 cc urine the day after placement , 950 cc of which came from nephrostomy tube .
The tube appeared to be functioning well , draining urine with occasional clot passage .
Urology was notified about the clots and occasional blood tinged urine but they did not make any further recommendations .
Cultures from urine drawn from the nephrostomy tube are currently growing > 100K GNR , possibly of two colony morphologies , speciation and sensitivity pending .
.
## Hct drop :
On admission to hospital patient had Hct of 29.2 .
In the setting of Right sublavian line placement as well as nephrostomy tube placement the patient was noted to have a drifting Hct , concerning for bleed , with nadir of 22.8 on 2014-12-01 .
A CT abdomen was performed which did not demonstrate any retroperitoneal bleed .
Hct stabilized to 24 for three days prior to discharge .
This can be followed as an outpatient .
Anemia workup revealed a picture of anemia of chronic disease ( TIBC 225 , B12 and Folate normal , Hapto 397 , Ferritin 51 , TRF 173 , Iron 35 ) .
.
## Hypoxia:
The patient on admission was requiring 3 L NC in the setting of receiving 2L NS and chest film which demonstrated pulmonary congestion .
The patient was not diuresed but allowed to auto-diurese any additional fluids and is currently with O2 sats 97-98% on room air .
As her BP remained stable she did not receiving any standing fluids but was be bolused as appropriate for a MAP < 60 or CVP < 8 with careful monitoring of pulmonary status .
Patient had an echocardiogram in 2012 which demonstrated an EF of 60-65% .
her O2 requirement by discharge was 96% on room air with no SOB .
.
## Steroid-induced hyperglycemia :
At home , the patient received metformin and SSI .
The patient 's metformin was held and she has been maintained on SSI qid while in the CMED .
As the patient appeared to be clinically stable , her stress dose steroids were discontinued and the patient was changed back to her home dose of Prednisone 40mg PO qd for maintenance with anticipated decrease in her blood sugars .
Her Metformin was re-added 2 days prior to discharge as well and fingerstick glucoses on the day of discharge were 93 and 156 , respectively .
.
## Hypothyroidism :
Repeat TSH and Free T4 were appropriate on current outpatient regimen. Patient was continued on Levothyroxine 75mcg po qd .
.
## H/o transverse myelitis/optic neuritis :
On stress dose steroids originally given MUST protocol and sepsis , as patient clinically stabilized , she was changed back to home dose of Prednisone 40mg pO qd .
.
## SLE :
Currently no sx of active disease .
No manifestations of SLE during this admission .
.
# Osteoporosis - We continued actonel/vit D , Tums
.
## Capsular ossification :
We continued CMED CSRU gtt .
.
## FEN:
She had a low bicarb likely due to renal wasting but there is an anion gap present .
Serum acetone was normal .
We followed lactate while she was in the CMED which was normal .
She was NPO periodically but maintained a normal diet prior to discharge .
.
# PPX - SQ Heparin during this admission , PPI
