HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Chest pain :
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction .
However , with her history of disease , patient underwent a cardiac catheterization .
The patient was found at cardiac catheterization to have mild diffuse instent restenosis in the mid stent , otherwise hemodynamically normal and the coronary arteries otherwise were without flow-limiting stenoses .
The patient was then continued on her cardiac medications .
It was felt that if we attempted aspirin desensitize her while an inpatient , then she would benefit from the use of aspirin and Plavix .
The patient was sent to the CCU and underwent aspirin desensitization protocol , which she tolerated well .
She had mild worsening of her asthma attacks , which was relieved by Benadryl and occasionally albuterol .
The patient found that if she took the aspirin in the evening with her Benadryl that she takes for sleep , that the asthma exacerbation did not occur .
Aspirin no longer should be considered an allergy for this patient , and she is going to take this as an outpatient .

This is a chronic issue and was controlled with Flexeril and Vicodin .
