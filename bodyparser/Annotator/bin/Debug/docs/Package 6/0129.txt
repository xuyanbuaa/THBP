** FINAL REPORT 2018-08-06 **
HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST ( Final 2018-08-06 ) :
NEGATIVE BY EIA .
( Reference Range-Negative ) .
GI bleed study - IMPRESSION :
Active radiotracer activity in the right lower quadrant in a serpingneous f fashion suggestive of distal small bowel .
EGD - Impression :
Angioectasias in the fundus
Angioectasias in the antrum
Angioectasias in the proximal jejunum and mid jejunum
Angioectasia in the duodenum
Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to mid jejunum
Recommendations :
No site of active bleeding was seen .
The fundal AVMs are a potential site of bleeding although do not explain the extent of bleeding .
Consider endoscopic argon plasma therapy
Proceed with colonoscopy .
Colonoscopy -
Impression :
Blood in the colon
Grade 1 external hemorrhoids
Angioectasia in the colon
Diverticulosis of the colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
Brief Hospital Course :
Blood loss anemia from GI bleeding - the bleeding was likely from an AVM .
EGD , colonoscopy and tagged scan results as above .
eventhough uptake was noted in the rt LQ , no clear site of bleeding was noticed on colonoscopy .
hence , no intervention was performed .
she was transfused with 5 units of PRBC in the ICU andsent to the Lahey Clinic - North Shore .
Her hematocrit remained stable for 4 days prior to discharge .
No further bleeding noted .
GI consult team followed pt in hospital .
On discussion with Dr Leigh and Dr White from GI - they recommended that she follow with Dr. Taylor for consideration of argon photocoagulation as out-patient .
Given the innumerable number of AVM 's , it is diffcult to assess which the culprit lesion is and GI may start APL from the fundus of stomach .
Patient to get CBC checked with PCP this week as below .
ASA was held and may be restarted if Hct stable in clinic at the PCP 's discretion .
Chronic thrombocytopenia was noted , however the patient did not require platelet transfusions .
Has a h/o HIT .
The metoprolol was held during acute bleeding phase and restarted prior to discharge as her BP stabilized .
Other medical problems stable .
Dialysis was continued 3 / week .
I personally talked with Dr Pannell at the time of discharge to update him with the hospital events .
