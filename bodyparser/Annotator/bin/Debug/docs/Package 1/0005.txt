HOSPITAL COURSE :
This is an 80 year old female with a history of Stage I breast cancer , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , who presents with a leukocytosis/bandemia , hypotension in the setting of dehydration and influenza .
After a short Medical Intensive Care Unit course where she remained hemodynamically stable , she was transferred to the floor .
Gerardi problem list is as follows :
Hypotension - This was likely secondary to volume depletion in the setting of a diarrheal and viral respiratory syndrome .
Her blood pressure was stable after three liters of normal saline .
She was clinically euvolemic after that .
She did receive two units of packed red blood cells .
There is no evidence of gastrointestinal bleed or adrenal insufficiency during the course of her evaluation .
Her antihypertensives were initially held and reinstated upon discharge .
Influenza A - DFA confirmed , the viral cultures were pending at the time of discharge .
The initial bandemia would not have been consistent with a typical influenza presentation , so she was continued on a fourteen day course of Levaquin to eliminate any possibility of a bacterial superinfection or early pneumonia .
Loose bowel movements - This problem was resolved and had been a viral syndrome on presentation .
There was no evidence of diarrhea during medical Lawrence Memorial Hospital stay .
Anemia - This is a chronic problem .
She has known iron deficiency .
There was no evidence of bleeding .
She was guaiac negative and the Hemophilus panel was negative .
