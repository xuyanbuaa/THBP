Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
2/15/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
2/28/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia , without remission , atrial fibrillation , chronic airway obstruction , hypopotassemia , cellulitis , orbital hemorrhage , protein calorie malnutrition , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , pulmonary hemorrhage / pneumonia , hyperglycemia , renal insufficiency , hyperuricemia , hypophosphatemia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea .
Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia .
He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up .
He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea .
He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler .
Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol .
He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 .
He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae .
There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing .
He had no cardiac murmur .
His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender .
The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells .
There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes .
The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 .
His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal .
His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 .
A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses .
There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions .
An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days .
He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this .
He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone .
His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea .
There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia .
Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen .
Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently .
A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .
He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol .
The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin .
The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection .
He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .
They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .
No autopsy was obtained .
