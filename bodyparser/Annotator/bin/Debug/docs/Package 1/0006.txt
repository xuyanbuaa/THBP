OTHER TREATMENTS / PROCEDURES ( NOT IN O.R. ) 
Cardiac Cath 1/6/0004 
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE : 
78 M w/ longstanding CAD s / p CABG '97 , had PPM and AICD placed in '02 after admitted for presyncope and found to have inducible VT . 
in USOH until this am when felt LH and then ICD discharge . 
Subsequent 4 ICD discharges at rest . 
Denies change in ET , chest pain , SOB . 
Went to OSH c further ICD shocks , VT on monitor but stable VS . 
Given amio bolu , started on gtt and transferred to NVH for further evaluation . 
Exam remarkable for b / l carotid bruits , soft murmur at L sternal border , clear chest , 1+ b / l edema .

CK :

MB :

ECG is AV paced but prior shower R on T VPB c monomorphic VT then overdrive paced . 
**** Course 
1) CV ( R ) finished amio IV load then started on po , agressive lytes ; although interrogation showed >100 episodes of VT ( as / x ) , pt prefers med therapy as opposed to ablation ( I ) enzymes mildly elevated but not actively ischemic ; lipids , ASA , statin , BB ; Adenosine thal 1/4 and echo 1/4 to look for signs of ischemia as active cause for VT ( P ) JVP at angle of jaw 1/4 --> giving 20 Lasix ; dig level 1/4 1.3 --> 1/2 dose as on Amio 
2) Endo : 
elevated glu on admit BMP and FSG also concurring --> follow and Lispro ; will probably need w / u as outpt 
3) Pulm : 
baseline PFTs as staring amio 
4) GI : 
baseline LFTs wnl ; taking cardiac / ADA diet as glu remains elevated 
5) Renal : 
baseline CRI ( 1.2-1.6 ) with elevation at admission probably prerenal ; will monitor BUN / Cr after giving Lasix 
6) Proph : 
PPI and pneumoboots 
HOSPITAL COURSE and OUTCOME : 
The patient was admitted to the cardiology service and commenced amiodarone loading . 
Adenosine stress MIBI revealed a small reversible defect in the PDA territory and the patient underwent coronary catheterisation on 1/6/0004 which revealed a 70% lesion in the SVG to PDA -> cypher stented successfully . 
He had occasional ventricular extopyon telemetry but no further recurrence of ventricular tachycardia . 
During his admission , his am fasting glucose levels were intermittently elevated and his HbA1C was greater than 7 . 
I have explained to him that he may have developed some glucose intolerance and that , in the first instance , he should see his Primary Care Physician and attempt dietary control . 
On the day prior to discharge he noticed a small area of erythema surrounding his R antecubital venous access site . 
This will be treated empirically with a 10 day course of Keflex . 
I have instructed him to see his PCP if it does not improve in a few days or if he develops fevers . 
In terms of his amiodarone , he will be discharged on 400mg po bid for a further 7 days followed by 400mg qd thereafter . 
He will followup with Dr. Levels in device clinic in 4 weeks . 
I have advised him that he must not drive until he is seena gain in clinic and his device interrogated .
