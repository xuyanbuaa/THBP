HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute and chronic shortness of breath .
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and thought likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension .
The patient was also found to have pulmonary hypertension .
She ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes .
On admission , she was diuresed with Lasix and was negative 1-2 liters per day for several days .
The diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 .
She was restarted on 20 mg p.o. q day prior to discharge .
Her lipids were checked with a total cholesterol of 110 , triglycerides 59 , HDL32 , LDL 64 .
The patient had a D-dimer greater than 1000 with lower extremity non-invasive studies which were positive for a small right common femoral clot .
It was unclear whether this was old or new .
A TTE showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral regurgitation , left atrial enlargement , mild tricuspid regurgitation , pulmonary artery pressures of 44 plus right atrial pressure .
There was an intra-atrial shunt from the right to the left through a patent foramen ovale .
Chest CT was a poor study but did not show a pulmonary embolus .
The patient had subsequent dobutamine MIBI which was positive for inducible ischemia in the distribution of posterior descending coronary artery and posterolateral coronary artery with a small to medium perfusion defect in the inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall which was partially reversible .
The cardiology service saw the patient and recommended medical management only without catheterization .
Her blood pressure was high so Captopril was titrated up to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. .
She will be discharged on Lisinopril with further titration as an outpatient .
She is on hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q day .
Her atenolol was stopped due to bradycardia on admission but this may be restarted as an outpatient in gentle doses with careful monitoring of heart rate .
She is on an aspirin .
She will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg for continued control of her edema .
2. Pulmonary ;
Pulmonary hypertension as seen on echocardiogram .
Unclear whether there are chronic pulmonary embolus but did have positive test for deep venous thrombosis and will be treated with Coumadin .
An ABG was done which showed pH 7.34 , pCO2 78 , pO2 92 on 2 liters .
Her bicarbonate peaked at 39 and generally is in the 36-38 range .
She has severe sleep apnea and falls asleep midsentence .
She has episodes of not breathing .
BIPAP was attempted for 3 nights in a row and the patient did not tolerate this .
She will need pulmonary function studies as an outpatient as these were not done in the hospital .
The pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing .
She needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen .
3. Infectious disease :
Evidence for cellulitis on her legs , likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion .
She was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to Keflex with good improvement .
She will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis .
4. Hematology :
D-dimer in the emergency room was greater than 1000 and a right common femoral clot was seen .
This clot was small and it was questionable as to whether it was old or new .
She was started on anticoagulation given the positive D-dimer .
Chest CT was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus .
It was a poor study .
Heparin was maintained during her hospital course and then Lovenox was started .
Her dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge .
She will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of Lovenox .
Discharge INR 1.8 .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
5. Fluids / electrolytes / nutrition :
Low salt diet .
Low cholesterol , low fat diet .
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE :
To rehabilitation .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
House diet .
No added salt .
Low saturated fat .
Low cholesterol .
ACTIVITY :
As tolerated .
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS :
The patient needs physical therapy to increase stability in mobilization .
Need to try to control blood pressure .
Can increase her Ace inhibitor as tolerated .
May start beta-blocker at a low dose given mild bradycardia at atenolol 50 mg p.o. q day .
Need to continue oxygen 2 liters via nasal cannula .
Needs anticoagulation for 6 months for right common femoral artery deep venous thrombosis .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
Should continue Keflex for 10 more days or as clinically indicated .
Need to follow INR after Keflex is discontinued as expect it will change .
The patient has severe sleep apnea and stops breathing during sleep .
This is her baseline status .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Satisfactory .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4-6 hours p.r.n. headache , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day , calcium gluconate 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enema of choice and laxative of choice p.o. q day p.r.n. constipation , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q day , Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o.q.h.s. for goal INR of 2.0-3.0 .
Keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. x 10 more days , Miconazole 2% powder topically b.i.d. apply to affected areas of breasts and groins b.i.d. , Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q day hold of systolic blood pressure less than 110 , Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneously q 12 hours x 2 doses and then discontinued , atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q day hold for a systolic blood pressure of less than 110 , heart rate less than 55 .
