A STAT HCT drawn at this time was 31.2 .
The patient was re-evalutated at 2000 and was found to be tacchycardic to 115 with BP 104/50 using a manual cuff .
Urine output during the prior two hours had been 50cc and 24cc .
A STAT HCT drawn at this time was 19.5 .
The clinical picture was concerning for a post-operative hematoma .
The ICU was alerted to the patient 's disposition and the operating room was activated for urgent re-exploration .
The patient was taken to the OR on POD#0 for re-exploration with incision at 2243 .
Exploratory laparotomy revealed hemoperitonium and approximately 1 L of blood was evacuated .
There was approximately 500cc of retroperitoneal clot .

At the conclusion of the case , the patient continued to bleed , allbeit at a less brisk pace .
The endotracheal tube was left in place .
Intraoperatively , the patient recieved 5u PRBC .
IR was consulted to identify the bleeding vessel with angiography , then perform embolization .
Tagged cell and angiographic studies performed immediately after re-exploration on 12-05 did not indetify active bleeding and no emobolization was indicated .
THe patient was stable and remained intubated .
The patient was admitted to the ICU for further care .
The patient 's ICU course was uneventful .
There was no evidence of continued bleeding and her HCT remained stable around 30 .
The pt self-extubated on POD #1 .
The patient developed a low grade fever to 100.1 on POD#1 which persisted to POD#2 and imperic treatment with gent/clinda was started .
The patient was stable for transfer to the CMED floor on POD#3 .
