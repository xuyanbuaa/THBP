HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 37-year-old female who presents on an elective basis for a living-related kidney transplant .
The patient has a history of end-stage renal failure secondary to type 1 diabetes with a baseline creatinine of around 5 .
She is receiving a kidney from her sister .
The patient has a history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , and insulin-dependent diabetes for 32 years .
She is status post myocardial infarction in April of this year and subsequently underwent coronary artery bypass surgery .
She present electively on the morning of her surgery with no recent changes in her medical problems .

1. Sarcoidosis since 2001 .
2. She is status post cholecystectomy .
3. Status post tubal ligation .
4. Status post left arteriovenous graft placement for hemodialysis .
5. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus times 32 years .
6. Hypertension .
7. Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction in 2012-05-06 .
8. End-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis for 1.5 years .
ALLERGIES :
Allergies include AMOXICILLIN and CODEINE .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Insulin by sliding-scale , NPH insulin 16 units in the morning and 6 units in the evening .
2. Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Zoloft 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is a half to one pack per day smoker for 10 years who quit approximately one week prior to her admission .
She denies alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
Physical examination at the time of admission revealed she was in no acute distress .
Blood pressure was 150/79 , a pulse of 81 .
She is legally blind .
She was without any adenopathy .
Her chest was clear to auscultation .
Heart had a normal S1 and S2 , with no murmurs , gallops or rubs .
Her abdomen was soft with well-healed incisions .
There was no organomegaly .
Extremities were without edema .
She had a functioning arteriovenous fistula with a thrill and a bruit in her left arm .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the preoperative holding area and taken electively to the operating room .
She underwent a living-related renal transplant in the right iliac fossa .
The operation was somewhat technically difficult secondary to a short segment of ureter which was anastomosed over a stent to the bladder .
Otherwise , there were difficulties , and estimated blood loss was minimal .
She was taken postoperatively to the recovery room already making a large amount of urine .
Intraoperatively , for immunosuppression she received thymoglobulin and Solu-Medrol .
She was started on Prograf and CellCept in the postoperative period .
She was also maintained on Bactrim postoperatively and did not require ganciclovir , as she and her sister were cytomegalovirus negative .
The patient 's initial postoperative course was relatively uneventful .
Her creatinine , which was 5 initially postoperatively , slowly dropped over the next few days until eventually reaching a low of 1 .
She did receive pamidronate on postoperative day one and received a total of four doses thymoglobulin .
Her steroid doses were slowly tapered over her hospital course , and her Prograf level was adjusted to maintain therapeutic values between 10 and 15 .
She continued to make good urine over the first few days and had her urine losses replaced with intravenous fluids .
On postoperative day three , the patient had an episode of shortness of breath that was evaluated by both the Renal and surgical residents .
It was found that she was in acute pulmonary edema and required transfer to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
Her blood pressure at the time of this incident was in the range of 200/120 .
Her electrocardiogram showed no specific ST changes , but there was some loss of her R wave progression laterally .
Serial enzymes were drawn , and Cardiology was consulted .
With blood pressure control via a nitroglycerin drip and fluid restriction , the patient quickly improved and a had a relatively short stay in the Intensive Care Unit .
Throughout this time , her creatinine continued to drop , and there was no apparent deleterious effect on her transplant from this episode .
Her beta blocker was progressively increased , and her nitroglycerin drip was weaned down .
Two days after this event , she underwent an echocardiogram which was significant for slightly depressed left ventricular systolic function with severe posterior wall hypokinesis .
This was a change from her prior echocardiogram and demonstrated evidence of a small myocardial infarction .
Clinically , she did much better and her blood pressure was optimized prior to discharge .
She was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day five and was stable on the floor for the next two days .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
She was set to be discharged to home on 11-28 , on postoperative day seven .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Prograf 4 mg p.o. b.i.d. ( this may change depending on her most recent Prograf level which will be drawn on the morning of 11-28 ) .
2. Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3. CellCept 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Bactrim 1 single-strength tablet p.o. q.d.
5. Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. NPH insulin 16 units q.a.m. and 6 units q.p.m.
7. Zoloft 175 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9. Reglan 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.
10. Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.
11. Lopressor 125 mg p.o. b.i.d.
12. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
13. Cardizem-CD 180 mg p.o. q.d.
