ADDENDUM
The patient was to be discharged from the hospital on **DATE[May 23 2007] or **DATE[May 24 2007] .
He went to IR for @@a picc line placement@@ for @@outpatient antibiotics@@ .
While on @@@venogram@@@ , @a subclavian thrombus@ was visualized .
At that time , we started the patient on @@a heparin drip@@ and monitored @@@his inr@@@ .
We wanted to reach @@@an inr@@@ of 2.0 prior to discharge .
We thought that we would be able to send the patient home with @@lovenox@@ and @@coumadin@@ .
However , the patient developed @acute renal failure@ .
@@@his creatinine@@@ had increased to 1.8 .
For that reason , we maintained the patient on @@heparin@@ and @@coumadin@@ firmly .
As mentioned , @@@his creatinine@@@ had increased to 1.8 .
We got @@@a renal ultrasound@@@ that was normal .
We continued to hydrate the patient .
However , @@@his creatinine@@@ remained @elevated@ .
We consulted Renal Service to help us with @@@his evaluation@@@ .
Their recommendation was , if okay with Infectious Disease , to discontinue @@the bactrim@@ to see if he would have a drop in @@@his creatinine@@@ .
Once off @@the bactrim@@ , @@@his creatinine@@@ slowly trended back to normal .
As part of @@@his evaluation@@@ , he did have @@@a urine eosinophil@@@ sent and this was negative .
On **DATE[May 23 2007] , once @@@his creatinine@@@ was back to normal , we spoke with Renal , and they said that it was okay for us to start him on @@lovenox@@ .
It will be important that we watch @@@his bun@@@ and @@@creatinine@@@ while he is still on @@the lovenox@@ .
While here , the patient continued to have @this persistent abdominal pain@ .
He did not have @any fevers@ or @chills@ at this time , however , had @continued nausea@ .
We did @@@an abdominal film@@@ on **DATE[May 28 2007] , and he had @stool throughout his gi track@ .
He was put on @@a bowel regime@@ with good outcome .
We also had General Surgery evaluate the patient as well .
We had @@@a ct scan@@@ done on **DATE[May 29 2007] , that showed just @a resolving abscess@ .
The spleen , kidney , and pancreas and the visualized bowel were normal .
Because @this abdominal pain@ really never went away , we reconsulted GI .
They reported that with @cgd@ you can sometimes have @granulomatous infiltration of the gi tract@ .
It is somewhat reported in about 33% of the patients with @cgd@ .
They said that this can only be confirmed through @@@a colonoscopy@@@ with @@@biopsy@@@ .
@@@his last colonoscopy@@@ was in **DATE[May 2006] , and was normal except for showing @some internal hemorrhoid@ .
@@@a repeat colonoscopy@@@ was done on **DATE[Jun 1 2007] , that was normal .
@@@a biopsy@@@ was taken at this time and is still pending .
Their recommendation was to allow the patient to advance his diet .
On **DATE[May 30 2007] , the patient developed @fever@ to 38.6 .
It was @an isolated fever@ .
At that time , we really did not have an etiology .
We did @@@blood cultures@@@ on that day and they were negative x 3 days .
We also had @@@a second set of cultures@@@ done on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] , and these were negative x 1 day .
We did really not have a reason for @his fever@ , and he has been @afebrile@ in the past 48 hours .
For final recommendations by Infectious Disease , we discontinued @@his vancomycin@@ on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] .
We kept @@the zosyn@@ and then on **DATE[Jun 3 2007] , discontinued @@the zosyn@@ , and we will start @@ceftriaxone@@ .
He will resume @@his rifampin@@ , which was started on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] .
He would not require @@any iv antibiotics@@ at discharge .
Abdominal pain :
After @@@the colonoscopy@@@ , the patient said that he had @increased pain@ after @@@this procedure@@@ .
We discussed this with General Surgery .
They evaluated the patient and ordered @@@a ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis@@@ to rule out @any free air@ or @bleeding@ .
This was negative .
GI recommended @@@another abdominal film@@@ that showed @a gas - filled colon@ that is expected following @@@a colonoscopy@@@ .
The patient had @decreasing white count@ since admission .
As expected with @his infection@ , @@@his white count@@@ was 10.6 on admission .
However , after @@his antibiotics@@ , @@@his white count@@@ came down between 4 and 5 .
Around **DATE[Jun 1 2007] , @@@his white count@@@ dropped from 4.4 down to 2.3 .
At the same time , @@@his absolute neutrophils@@@ had gone from the 2 to 3 range , on **DATE[Jun 3 2007] , down to 0.80 .
This may have been caused by @@the vancomycin@@ or @@the zosyn@@ .
The recommendation is to see if @@@the absolute neutrophil count@@@ increases after the patient is offered @@the vancomycin@@ and @@zosyn@@ for a day or two .
We have placed the patient in @@neutropenic precautions@@ until we see @@@this level@@@ increase .
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS :
1. Primary care physician , Dr. **NAME[RRR] in 9 South Montefiore on **DATE[Jun 27 2007] , at 10:30 a.m. , **PHONE .
2. @@@ct scan@@@ is changed to **DATE[Jun 27 2007] , at 12:46 .
3. Dr. **NAME[QQQ] on **DATE[Jun 27 2007] , at 1:30 ( the CT scan appointment had changed to ensure the patient has @@@a ct scan@@@ prior to seeing Dr. **NAME[QQQ] ) .
NOTATION :
The patient had received @@compazine@@ during this stay for @nausea@ .
However , after having @@the compazine@@ , the patient felt @very anxious@ and felt @palpitations@ .
We changed him back to @@the phenergan@@ that he was on and will not want a substitution for @@the compazine@@ .
A completed list of @@the discharge medications@@ on the day of discharge will be added to this .
