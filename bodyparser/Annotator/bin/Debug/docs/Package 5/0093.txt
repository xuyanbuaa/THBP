HOSPITAL COURSE :
In summary , patient is a 53 - year-old female with multiple medical problems and history of depression with intentional overdose of barbiturates , opiates , Tylenol , and beta blocker .
CMED :
Patient was maintained on insulin , D10 and glucagon drips to maintain her hemodynamics .
This was achieved with good effect , and they were subsequently weaned off .
Patient was able to be extubated on hospital day three .
Psychiatry was consulted after the patient was extubated , and felt that patient had a high suicide risk , and plan was for her to be admitted to the Psychiatry service once medically stable .
Patient 's renal function remained stable and her CKs trended down gradually .
Patient remained on suicide precautions , but was deemed not to need ICU level monitoring , and was transferred to the floor on 01-11 .
In the a.m. of 01/08 , the patient experienced episode of tongue biting , unresponsiveness , disorientation .
Was loaded on Dilantin .
Became progressively hypoxic and tachypneic throughout the day with respiratory rates of 30-40 with a max respiratory rate of 116 , tachycardia to 120s .
Patient subsequently was transferred back to the CMED CCU on 2017-01-13 for further monitoring .
Patient 's hypoxia was felt most likely to be caused by pneumonia .
She was started on appropriate antibiotics .
Etiology of patient 's tachypnea was unclear .
Initially , the patient 's etiology of seizure was not quite clear , but thought possibly secondary to alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal .
She received EEG , MRI , LP .
Subsequently EEG was noted to have no seizure activity .
MRI was suboptimal due to motion artifact and LP was unremarkable .
Despite absence of seizure activity on EEG , patient was continued on Dilantin .
Her delirium was felt possibly secondary to withdrawal versus toxic metabolic , but gradually improved slowly , and therefore patient did not receive treatment for barbiturate withdrawal .
Her mental status , tachypnea , and hypoxia all improved , and patient was subsequently transferred back to the floor medical team on 2017-01-15 .
While on the floor , the patient 's mental status was noted to be improved back at baseline compared to that back to the CMED CCU , and she exhibited no evidence of barbiturate withdrawal .
She was continued on suicide precautions with a one-to-one sitter , and plan was for psychiatric admission when medical issues had resolved .
On 2017-01-16 , the night float intern was called to see the patient as she was unresponsive .
Patient unresponsive to verbal command , sternal rub .
Pupils were fixed and dilated .
Patient noted to be without corneal reflexes , spontaneous breathing , heart sounds , or palpable pulses .
Patient was pronounced dead at 6:15 a.m. on 2017-01-16 .
Patient 's family was notified and declined autopsy .
Given the sudden unexpected nature of patient 's death , the medical examiner was contacted and the case was accepted .
Of note at time of death , patient was DNR / DNI .
This was initiated after several conversations with the patient 's mother , who stated that the patient had desired to be DNR / DNI for many years , not just in the recent past .
These facts were confirmed via separate conversations with both the patient 's lawyer and her primary care physician .
