ATTENDING PHYSICIAN :
**NAME[YYY M ZZZ]
ADMISSION DATE :
``**DATE[May 17 2007``{2007Y5M17DHMS}{2007Y5M17DHMS}
DISCHARGE DATE :
``**DATE[Jun 05 2007``{2007Y6M5DHMS}{2007Y6M5DHMS}
ADDENDUM
The patient was to be discharged from the hospital on ``**DATE[May 23 2007``{2007Y5M23DHMS}{2007Y5M23DHMS} or ``**DATE[May 24 2007``{2007Y5M24DHMS}{2007Y5M24DHMS} .
He went to IR for a PICC line placement for outpatient antibiotics .
While on venogram , a subclavian thrombus was visualized .
``At that time``{YMDHMS}{YMDHMS} , we started the patient on a heparin drip and monitored his INR .
We wanted to reach an INR of 2.0 ``prior to discharge``{YMDHMS}{YMDHMS} .
We thought that we would be able to send the patient home with Lovenox and Coumadin .
However , the patient developed acute renal failure .
His creatinine had increased to 1.8 .
For that reason , we maintained the patient on heparin and Coumadin firmly .
As mentioned , his creatinine had increased to 1.8 .
We got a renal ultrasound that was normal .
We continued to hydrate the patient .
However , his creatinine remained elevated .
We consulted Renal Service to help us with his evaluation .
Their recommendation was , if okay with Infectious Disease , to discontinue the Bactrim to see if he would have a drop in his creatinine .
Once off the Bactrim , his creatinine slowly trended back to normal .
As part of his evaluation , he did have a urine eosinophil sent and this was negative .
On ``**DATE[May 23 2007``{2007Y5M23DHMS}{2007Y5M23DHMS} , once his creatinine was back to normal , we spoke with Renal , and they said that it was okay for us to start him on Lovenox .
It will be important that we watch his BUN and creatinine while he is still on the Lovenox .
While here , the patient continued to have this persistent abdominal pain .
He did not have any fevers or chills ``at this time``{YMDHMS}{YMDHMS} , however , had continued nausea .
We did an abdominal film on ``**DATE[May 28 2007``{2007Y5M28DHMS}{2007Y5M28DHMS} , and he had stool throughout his GI track .
He was put on a bowel regime with good outcome .
We also had General Surgery evaluate the patient as well .
We had a CT scan done on ``**DATE[May 29 2007``{2007Y5M29DHMS}{2007Y5M29DHMS} , that showed just a resolving abscess .
The spleen , kidney , and pancreas and the visualized bowel were normal .
Because this abdominal pain really never went away , we reconsulted GI .
They reported that with CGD you can sometimes have granulomatous infiltration of the GI tract .
It is somewhat reported in about 33% of the patients with CGD .
They said that this can only be confirmed through a colonoscopy with biopsy .
His last colonoscopy was ``in **DATE[May 2006]``{2006Y5MDHMS}{2006Y5MDHMS} , and was normal except for showing some internal hemorrhoid .
A repeat colonoscopy was done ``on **DATE[Jun 1 2007``{2007Y6M1DHMS}{2007Y6M1DHMS} , that was normal .
A biopsy was taken ``at this time``{YMDHMS}{YMDHMS} and is still pending .
Their recommendation was to allow the patient to advance his diet .
``On **DATE[May 30 2007``{2007Y5M30DHMS}{2007Y5M30DHMS} , the patient developed fever to 38.6 .
It was an isolated fever .
At that time , we really did not have an etiology .
We did blood cultures on that day and they were negative x 3 days .
We also had a second set of cultures done ``on **DATE[Jun 2 2007``{2007Y6M2DHMS}{2007Y6M2DHMS} , and these were negative x 1 day .
We did really not have a reason for his fever , and he has been afebrile ``in the past 48 hours``{YMDHMS}{YMDHMS}  .
For final recommendations by Infectious Disease , we discontinued his vancomycin ``on **DATE[Jun 2 2007``{2007Y6M2DHMS}{2007Y6M2DHMS} .
We kept the Zosyn and then ``on **DATE[Jun 3 2007``{2007Y6M3DHMS}{2007Y6M3DHMS} , discontinued the Zosyn , and we will start ceftriaxone .
He will resume his rifampin , which was started ``on **DATE[Jun 2 2007``{2007Y6M2DHMS}{2007Y6M2DHMS} .
He would not require any IV antibiotics ``at discharge``{YMDHMS}{YMDHMS} .
Abdominal pain :
After the colonoscopy , the patient said that he had increased pain after this procedure .
We discussed this with General Surgery .
They evaluated the patient and ordered a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out any free air or bleeding .
This was negative .
GI recommended another abdominal film that showed a gas - filled colon that is expected following a colonoscopy .
The patient had decreasing white count ``since admission``{YMDHMS}{YMDHMS} .
As expected with his infection , his white count was 10.6 ``on admission``{YMDHMS}{YMDHMS} .
However , after his antibiotics , his white count came down between 4 and 5 .
Around ``**DATE[Jun 1 2007``{2007Y6M1DHMS}{2007Y6M1DHMS} , his white count dropped from 4.4 down to 2.3 .
At the same time , his absolute neutrophils had gone from the 2 to 3 range , ``on **DATE[Jun 3 2007``{2007Y6M3DHMS}{2007Y6M3DHMS} , down to 0.80 .
This may have been caused by the vancomycin or the Zosyn .
The recommendation is to see if the absolute neutrophil count increases after the patient is offered the vancomycin and Zosyn ``for a day or two``{YMDHMS}{YMDHMS} .
We have placed the patient in neutropenic precautions until we see this level increase .
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS :
1. Primary care physician , Dr. **NAME[RRR] in 9 South Montefiore ``on **DATE[Jun 27 2007, at 10:30 a.m.``{2007Y6M27D10H30MS}{2007Y6M27D10H30MS}  , **PHONE .
2. CT scan is changed to ``**DATE[Jun 27 2007, at 12:46``{2007Y6M27D12H46MS}{2007Y6M27D12H46MS} .
3. Dr. **NAME[QQQ] ``on **DATE[Jun 27 2007, at 1:30``{2007Y6M27D1H30MS}{2007Y6M27D1H30MS}  ( the CT scan appointment had changed to ensure the patient has a CT scan prior to seeing Dr. **NAME[QQQ] ) .
NOTATION :
The patient had received Compazine during this stay for nausea .
However , after having the Compazine , the patient felt very anxious and felt palpitations .
We changed him back to the Phenergan that he was on and will not want a substitution for the Compazine .
A completed list ``of the discharge``{YMDHMS}{YMDHMS} medications ``on the day of discharge``{YMDHMS}{YMDHMS} will be added to this .
