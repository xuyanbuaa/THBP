HOSPITAL COURSE :
Shortness of breath - Though the patient denied shortness of breath on admission , a progress note from
Norwood nursing facility suggested that the patient had been having shortness of breath and cough for approximately one day with difficulty ambulating , needing to travel in a wheelchair .
The patient was afebrile on admission with a normal white blood cell count but had significant wheezing and rales on physical examination with a possible left lower lobe opacity seen on chest x-ray .
The etiology of the patient 's shortness of breath was considered a likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and the patient was started on Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers .
The patient was also started on Doxycycline given the concern for pneumonia on chest x-ray .
She was also continued on steroids given evidence of severe airway obstruction .
The patient 's shortness of breath was also considered possibly related to a coronary event and she was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
The patient 's enzymes were cycled and were negative .
The patient 's electrocardiogram performed on hospital day number two was concerning for 2:1 heart block and the cardiology consult service was contacted for evaluation .
The patient was taken to the Coronary Care Unit late on hospital day number two and received a temporary wire .
The following day the patient received a permanent dual chamber rate responsive pacemaker .
The patient was transferred back to the general medicine service where she continued to exhibit signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and nebulizers , steroids and antibiotics were continued .
The patient 's respiratory status improved throughout the remainder of her hospitalization and oxygen was eventually weaned .
Once the patient was transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit , she appeared to have an element of heart failure in addition to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
She was given 20 mg of intravenous Lasix with impressive urine output and improvement in her overall fluid status .
The patient was eventually restarted on her outpatient dose of Lasix once her renal function improved to baseline and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of her hospitalization .
Heart block - As noted previously , the patient 's electrocardiogram was significant for a 2:1 heart block and cardiology consult service was contacted for evaluation .
The patient received a temporary pacing wire on the evening of hospital day number two and on hospital day number three received a dual chamber pacemaker .
Renal - The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.8 , considered likely secondary to hypovolemia .
Her calculated fractional excretion of sodium was 0.13 percent suggesting a prerenal cause .
The patient 's creatinine improved to 1.1 with hydration .
Once the patient 's creatinine had improved to baseline , her Lasix and ace inhibitor were restarted and the patient 's creatinine was noted to be stable .
Gastrointestinal - The patient was admitted with a history of gastrointestinal bleed with guaiac positive stools on admission .
Her hematocrit was noted to trend down after transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells on admission .
Given guaiac positive stools and her history of gastrointestinal bleed in addition to use of steroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation , the gastroenterology consult service was contacted .
The results of that consultation and potential esophagogastroduodenoscopy are pending at the time of dictation .
Hypertension - The patient had moderate control of her blood pressure throughout her admission .
Her calcium channel blocker and ace inhibitor were continued .
Hematology - As noted previously , the patient 's hematocrit was noted to drop after transfusion with one unit of packed red blood cells on admission .
Given guaiac positive stools and the patient 's history of gastrointestinal bleed , gastroenterology consult service was contacted for possible esophagogastroduodenoscopy and/or colonoscopy .
The results of this consultation are pending at the time of dictation .
The remainder of the Hubbard Regional Hospital hospital course , discharge diagnoses , medications and follow-up will be dictated at the time of discharge .
